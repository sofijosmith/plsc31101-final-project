Is a mother allowed to abort the feotus, if she does not want it while the soul has not yet entered it and there is no serious danger to the mother’s life?","She is not allowed to do that, except if the continuation of the pregnancy would considerably harm her health or put her in an unbearable difficulty, then it is permissible before the soul enters the feoutus (i.e. the fourth month).","Sistani","pregnancy","pregnancy"

Sometimes the doctors reach the following conclusion: This foetus is afflicted with a very serious disease; it is therefore preferable that it should be aborted because if that child is born, it will be deformed or will die soon after birth. Is it, therefore, permissible for the doctor to abort the foetus? Is it permissible for the mother to agree to the abortion? And who of the two will become liable for indemnity?","Just the fact that the child will be deformed or that it will not live for a long time after his birth does not ever justify the termination of the pregnancy. Therefore, it is not permissible for the mother to consent to the abortion just as it is not permissible for the doctor to go ahead with the procedure. And whoever performs the abortion will become liable for the payment of indemnity.","Sistani","pregnancy,mother,abortion,abortion","pregnancy,mother,abortion,abortion"

What is the kaffara of abortion?","In case the mother aborts the child, she must give the indemnity (blood money) to the father or other heirs. And if the father carries out the abortion, the indemnity is obligatory on him and he must give it to the mother.  If it is the doctor who carries out the abortion, it is obligatory on him to give the blood money to the mother and father, even if he may abort the fetus on the parents’ request. He must give the blood money except if the heirs (i.e. the mother and father)exempt him. 
It would suffice for the blood money of the fetus into which soul has entered to give 5250 mithqals of silver. That is when the fetus is male and if it is female, half of that amount should be paid. 
If the fetus is lifeless and it is in the form of a fertilized ovum (zygote), 105 mithqals of silver would suffice for the blood money. In case it is in the form of a leech-like substance, the indemnity is 210 mithqals. If it develops into a chewed-like substance, the indemnity is 315 mithqals. If the fetus has bones, 420 mithqals of silver would suffice. If it has developed into a complete human body with grown up limbs and organs, the indemnity is 525 mithqals of silver. If the fetus is soulless, there is no difference between a male fetus and a female one as an obligatory precaution. The Soul enters the body at the fourth month of pregnancy except for when it is proved otherwise through modern technology. 
If the fetus is alive and it is aborted, the indemnity is 5250 mithqal of silver for a male child and 2625 mithqal for a female child. 
*Every mithqal of silver is equivalent to 4.64 g of Silver.*","Sistani","mother,abortion,mother,abortion,mother,mother,female,female,pregnancy,female","mother,abortion,mother,abortion,mother,mother,female,female,pregnancy,female"

I have a medical illness, and have become pregnant recently, under what circumstances is an abortion allowed?","Abortion is not allowed after the implantation of the [fertilized] ovum [on the lining of the womb], except if the mother’s life is in danger,  and in this case, it would be permissible to abort the foetus as long as the soul has not entered into it (i.e. before the end of 4 months); after the entering of the soul, it is not permissible, as an obligatory precaution.","Sistani","mother","mother"

Are we allowed to adopt children and consider them as our own children?","It is permissible for a person to adopt a child and taking care of a deserving child on its own earns is a rewarding deed, but the child legally (Islamic Shariah) is not considered his son or daughter; i.e. the child remains non-mahram to him or his wife and he or she does not inherit from the ones who has adopted him or her. 
Adoption in the sense to change a child's surname and register him in the official documents as the parents own child is not permissible.","Sistani","daughter,mahr,wife","daughter,mahr,wife"

What is the stance of Islam in regards to adopting children and if a child is with the family from his or her early days and develops a bond, do the laws of Mahram and Non-Mahram still have to be observed?","Adoption in the sense of claiming a child as your own son or daughter and getting official legal documents for him or her in your name is not permissible. 
However, there is no Ishkaal (objection) in taking care of a child, raising him or her and showing love and care, which is in itself rewarding but the child's lineage has to be preserved. 
In addition, the child would remain non-Mahram once reached the age of Buloogh (puberty). 
At the appropriate moment, the child should be informed about it (being adopted0 and if one cannot inform the child, he should record it somewhere or ask someone to bear witness that he/she is not his child.","Sistani","daughter","daughter"

What is the philosophy of Azadari (mourning and lamentation) for Imam Husain?","There is no doubt that the tragedy of Kerbala, when ascribed to the killers, is a criminal and terrible act. However when ascribed to Husain (A) himself, it represents a conscious confrontation and a courageous resistance for a sacred cause. The whole nation had failed to stand up to Yazid. They had succumbed to his will, and deviation and regression towards the pre-Islamic ways were increasing.
Passiveness by Husain (A) in this situation would have meant the end of Islam as we know it. Thus Husain (A) took upon himself the responsibility of the whole nation. The greatest tragedy was that one who stood up for the noblest of causes, the defense of Islam, was cut down in so cruel a manner.
It is for this reason that the sacrifice of Husain (A) is commemorated annually throughout the Muslim world. Our sorrow never abates as we relive the tragedy.
The commemoration of Ashura on the 10th of Muharram every year serves to remind us of the sacrifices of the family of the Prophet (S). It also makes us aware of the people, then and now, who tried to destroy Islam and the family of the Prophet (S) and all that they stood for - as well as those who watched, listened and did nothing.","Sistani","family,family","family,family"

Due to a number of miscarriages, the doctors have stated due to my condition, I can no longer get pregnant, are we, as husbands and wives, able to use our own fertilised egg and use a ""surrogate mother"", to carry the feotus in their womb?","If the sperm and egg belong to the husband and wife and the inseminated egg is then implanted in another woman's womb, there is no problem. It is permissible per se. However, since implanting involves touching and seeing the private part, insemination would be allowed only when the parties to the marriage may face difficulty in their life which is not normally bearable. If this is the case, looking and touching would be allowed to the necessary extent.  
However, when it comes to who the child belongs to, the owner of the egg or the owner of the womb, that is a problematic issue. In any case, precaution has to be observed in inheritance. As for mahramiyah, the owner of sperm is the legal father and the owner of the egg is mahram (related) to the child because she is her father's wife and the owner of the womb is mahram to him because she is like his mother.","Sistani","wife,woman,marriage,mahr,mahr,wife,mahr,mother","wife,woman,marriage,mahr,mahr,wife,mahr,mother"

A man lived with a woman whom he intended to marry and also had sex with her without entering into a marriage contract (‘aqd); thereafter he married her in the proper religious way. Is their co-habitation before the ‘aqd considered marriage in the eyes of religious law? Does the subsequent ‘aqd have retroactive effect? What will be the status of the children born before the ‘aqd?","In [an Islamic] marriage, the spousal relationship is established by the verbal expression of the proposition and the acceptance (Nikah 'aqd). More over no action or deed that reflects the intention of marriage can be a substitute for the spoken words. Consequently, the marriage mentioned in the question is not valid except after the pronouncement of the religious marriage formula that does not have any retroactive effect.
As for the children, they will be considered legitimate if the parents did not know the law [requiring the ‘aqd] because their relationship will be classified as “wat’i bis-shubha”. But if both were aware of the law, their relationship is considered adulterous. Consequently the children will be deemed illegitimate.

What is the proper definition of 'backbiting'? Please, give some references from the Quran and Hadith also.","Backbiting means “speaking ill of a believer in their absence of someone with the purpose of disparaging him, no matter whether the alleged shortcoming was related to his body, lineage, behaviour, deeds, statements, religion, or life, and other defects which are [usually] concealed from the people. Similarly, it does not matter whether the description was done by words or by gesture.”
Almighty Allãh condemned backbiting in His noble Book and has described it such that mind and body feel abhorrence towards it. He said, “And some of you should not backbite the others: would anyone of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? No, you abhor it.” (49:12)
The Prophet (s.a.w.) said, “Be careful of backbiting because backbiting is worse than adultery, in that a person who commits adultery can repent and ask forgiveness from God, and Allãh can forgive him whereas Allãh will not forgive the backbiter until the person who was at the receiving end forgives him.”","Sistani","adultery,adultery","adultery,adultery"

What is the blood money for aborting a child? Who is the blood money given to? Who receives the blood money?","In case the mother aborts the child, she must give the blood money (Diyyah) to the father or other heirs.

If it is the doctor who carries out the abortion, it is obligatory on him to give the blood money although he may abort the child on the parents’ request, (though they would share in the sin).

It would suffice for the blood money of the fetus into which soul has entered to give 525 mithqals of silver. That is when the fetus is male and if it is female, half of that amount should be paid. As a measure of obligatory precaution, the Diyyah of the fetus which dies in the womb is also the same. 
1) If the fetus is lifeless and it is in the form of a fertilized ovum (zygote), 105 mithqals of silver would suffice for the blood money (0-40 days). 
2) In case it is in the form of a leech-like substance, the Diyyah is 210 mithqals (40-80 days). 
3) If it develops into a chewed-like substance, the Diyyah is 315 mithqals (80-120 days). 
4) If the fetus has bones, 420 mithqals of silver would suffice.

Which is better for a woman,  performing prayers in a congregation or performing prayers individually?","It is recommended for women to attend congregational prayers as evidenced by an authentic tradition from the Commander of the Faithful, Ali (AS) that women used to attend congregational prayers but they were ordered to linger their sajda (prostration)  because some men were wearing tight garments but there is another authentic tradition which says that a woman's prayer at home is more virtuous than her prayer in a mosque. However, the conclusion that can be drawn from both traditions is that a woman's prayer at a place where she is not seen by non-mahram men (strangers) is more virtuous. If she can perform her prayers in a mosque without being seen by strangers, the prayer in a mosque would be more virtuous in that case.","Sistani","women,women,woman,woman,mahr","women,women,woman,woman,mahr"

Does masturbating during daytime of Ramadhan invalidate the fast, regardless of whether or not it leads to ejaculation? What is the penalty that should be incurred by one who does so?

A discharges fluid when she starts thinking about her husband or when seeing something simply exciting? Does the emission make her fast void?","The fluid which a woman feels during foreplay or lustful thinking but it is not much to spread to other parts, is clean. Ghusl does not become obligatory in this case and it does not make wudhu void either but if there is much fluid and is called ejaculation and the fluid spreads to the underwear and this normally takes place during orgasm and full satisfaction, the fluid is najis (impure) and in this case ghusl becomes obligatory. In fact, if emission takes place without orgasm, the necessary precaution is that it is najis and it causes janabah.
Hence, if a woman enters the state of janabah intentionally with the details mentioned above, both Qadha and kaffara become obligatory on her. The obligatory precaution is that she should restrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. ","Sistani","woman,woman","woman,woman"

I would appreciate, if you kindly tell me the necessary conditions by which a person becomes Mustati' (financially and bodily capable). I am asking this question because I really want to know whether or not I am qualified for Hajj.","Hajj is obligatory on a person once in his lifetime, provided that he fulfils the following conditions:
I. Being Baligh (adult).
II. Being sane and free.
III. Because of proceeding to Mecca for Hajj, should not be obliged to commit a Haram act, avoidance of which is more important than Hajj, nor should he be compelled to forsake an obligatory work which is more important than Hajj.
He should be capable of performing Hajj, and this depends upon a number of factors:
(a) He should possess provisions as described in relevant books and means for transportation, if need be, or he should have enough money to buy them, or get tickets.
(b) He should be healthy and strong enough to go to Mecca and perform Hajj.
(c) There should be no obstacle on the way.

Some women use certain pills to delay the onset of their monthly period so as to be able to perform their religious obligations, such as fasting and hajj  rituals.

They had succumbed to his will, and deviation and regression towards the pre-Islamic ways were increasing. Passiveness by Husain (A) in this situation would have meant the end of Islam as we know it.

What are the conditions for slaughtering of an animal?","There are certain conditions for the slaughtering of an animal. They are as follows:-
   1. A person, a man or a woman, who slaughters an animal must be a Muslim. An animal can also be slaughtered by a Muslim child who is mature enough to distinguish between good and bad, but not by non-Muslims other than Ahle Kitab, or a person belonging to those sects who are classified as Kafir, like, Nawasib - the enemies of Ahlul Bait (A.S.). In fact, even if Ahle Kitab non-Muslim slaughters an animal, as per precaution, it will not be halal, even if he utters 'Bismillah'.
   2. The animal should be slaughtered with a weapon made of iron. However, if an implement made of iron is not available, it should be slaughtered with a sharp object like glass or stone, so that the four veins are severed, even if the slaughtering may not be necessary, like when the animal is on the verge of death.
   3. When an animal is slaughtered, it should be facing Qibla. If the animal is sitting or standing, then facing Qibla would be like a man standing towards Qibla while praying. And if it is lying on its right or left side, then its neck and stomach should be facing Qibla. It is not necessary that its legs, hands and face be towards Qibla.
      If a person who knows the rule, purposely ignores placing the animal towards Qibla, the animal would become haraam; but if he forgets or does not know the rule, or makes a mistake in ascertaining the Qibla, or does not know the direction of Qibla, or is unable to turn the animal towards Qibla, there is no objection. As a recommended precaution, the person slaughtering should also face Qibla.
   4. When a person wants to slaughter an animal, just as he makes the Niyyat to slaughter, he should utter the name of Allah, and it suffices if he says 'Bismillah' only, or if he utters 'Allah'. But if he utters the name of Allah without the intention of slaughtering the animal, the slaughtered animal does not become Pak and it is also haraam to eat its meat. And if he did not utter the name of Allah forgetfully, there is no objection.
   5. The animal should show some movement after being slaughtered; at least it should move its eyes or tail or strike its foot on the ground.This law applies only when it is doubtful whether or not the animal was alive at the time of being slaughtered, otherwise it is not essential.
   6. It is necessary that the blood should flow in normal quantity from the slaughtered animal. If someone blocks the vein, not allowing blood to flow out, or if the bleeding is less than normal, that animal will not be halal. But if the blood which flows is less because the animal bled profusely before the slaughter, there is no objection.
   7. The animal should be slaughtered from its proper place of slaughtering; on the basis of recommended precaution, the neck should be cut from its front, and the knife should be used from the back of the neck.","Sistani","woman","woman"

It is permissible to marry her temporarily after her divorce and after the completion of the ‘idda from her non-Muslim husband. (The period of her ‘idda is not different from the ‘idda of a Muslim woman.) Therefore, it is not permissible before the completion of the ‘idda.

									   I want to know why temporary marriage is permissible.
								","
									   Muslims have unanimously agreed that temporary marriage was legislated by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). The second caliph stopped people from doing it during his rule at a famous incident. Since it was legislated by the Prophet, it remains lawful and valid. And this is what the followers of the Ahlul-bait (peace be upon him) and a group of the companions of the prophets (peace be upon him) believe.
								","Hakeem","marriage","marriage"
"2441",1776,"
									   Some Muslims object to the permissibility of temporary marriage. Can you please provide me with evidence to support its legality?
								","
									   There is no doubt that the temporary marriage is legislated. Proof is present in the Holy Book and the noble traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) which are authenticated in the Sunni and Shia books. What happened after that is that the second Caliph prevented it and its prohibition then became widely accepted amongst the Sunni scholars. What indicates its legislation from the Holy Book is the following verse  â€œIt is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom you seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty."" (24 4) In the book of Nail Al-Awtar, Vol.6, Pg.270, it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas used to recite this verse and he used to add ""by a set time"" after ""And those of whom you seek content"" and this clearly explains the legislation of the temporary marriage. In this same book it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas stated that temporary marriage was a mercy that Almighty Allah has given to his slaves and if it was not the forbidding of Umar, no one would ever need to commit adultery.  In the book of Al-Muhalla, vol. 9, pg. 520, the author, Ibn Hazm, stated  ""The permissibility of temporary marriage after the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) was affirmed by a group of his companions like Asma, the daughter of Abu Bakr, Jabir bin Abdillah, Ibn Masoud, Ibn Abbas, Moawiyah bin Abi Sufyan ""The list continues on until he said  ""and most jurists of the holy city of Mecca"". From this, one can conclude that the disagreement started after the prohibition of Umar and not in its legislation itself.

									   I understand that temporary marriage is for pleasure. Does that mean that physical attraction and lust are permissible reasons to enter into such a contract, or are there other prerequisite motivations that one must have before two people can enter into this arrangement?
								","
									   It is permissible to enter into temporary marriage for the sake of pleasure and lust via legislated means and within religious guidelines. Among the benefits of temporary marriage is that it controls sexual relation between the two sexes within specific rules and guidelines; like specifying the duration of the marriage and the dower, serving the waiting period between one marriage and another, and the child born from such a matrimony being legitimate for the couple. There is no doubt that if such marriage was common in the society, committing adultery would be minimal.

								","
									   If the two parties agreed on forming a marriage contract between them in such a way that the paid money is considered as dower like the permanent marriage, then the marriage is valid.

									   Are the wives of the Prophet included in Ahlulbayt (peace be upon them) according to the 33rd verse of Surah al-Ahzab?
								","
									   The verse does not include the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) since the wife – based on Arabic custom – is not included in the term “household” usually. This term refers to the genealogy of the man and his relatives by blood. It was narrated in the book “Lisan ul-Arab” that Ibn Sayyidah – an expert in Arabic linguistics – stated that the term “ahl” refers to the tribe of the man and his blood relatives. Apparently, this meaning was clear during the first era of Islam, since history did not mention that the aforementioned term is given to the wives by the companions of the Prophet. It was not used by the wives of the Prophet themselves. Aisha – for example – led an army to fight Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and her supporters were trying to gain the support of Muslims by any possible mean. Yet they did not mention that she is a member of the Ahlulbait. It appears from numerous traditions narrated by Muslims in general that the Messenger of Allah used this phrase to refer to Ali, Hasan, Husain and Fatima (peace be upon them). Ahmed bin Hanbal narrated in his book (Al-Musnad) from Umm Salama that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) told Fatima (peace be upon her), “Call for me your husband and your two sons”. She did so, and he then placed a blanket over them and then he placed his hand over them and said  ”O Lord, these are the Aal of Mohammad, so place your blessings on Mohammad and the Aal of Mohammad. All praise and glory belong to you.” Umm Salama raised the blanket to join with them. The Messenger of Allah prevented her and said  “Your future is good”. Many other traditions narrated by Sunni scholars mentioned clearly that the noble verse (33 33) was revealed while they were under the blanket. In addition to that, what some of the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) did clearly indicates that they were not purified from committing sins; some verses of chapter 66 (al-Tahreem) were revealed condemning Aisha and Hafsa since they aided one another against the Messenger of Allah. It was also narrated that one of the Prophet’s wife, Qutaila bint Qais left the religion of Islam after the death of the Prophet and got married to Ikrama bin Abi Jahl.

									   Some people say that Islam is not something which should be connected with a family, like the family of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they use this for their argument against the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Please comment on this.
								","
									   Our connection to the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is not emotional; rather, it is religious and based on their infallibility. Almighty Allah has ordered us to follow them. He said  ""Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Ahlulbait, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing""(33 33). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered us to follow them. He said  ""I am leaving amongst you the two weighty things, the book of Allah, and my progeny"". In addition to that, there are narrations about each and every one of the Imams of the Ahlulbait specifically. As an example, the Messenger of Allah said  “Ali is your Wali (i.e. guardian) after me” and he said  “Whoever’s master I am, Ali is his master”. These and other religious texts show that these people have special characteristics that enable them to take their position of imamate and leadership. So the issue is not emotional, nor is it based on a tribe or a family. On the other hand, most believers in the Sunni sect accepted the legitimacy of the caliphate of the Umayyads and Abbasids, although both of these states were established and continued on the basis of inheritance and without any entitlement at all.

									   How can we prove Imamate from the Quran? If Imamate is such a backbone for Shia Islam and we believe that if one does not accept the Wilayah of Imam Ali (peace be upon him), he is at loss, then why did not Allah mention this directly in the Holy Quran, thus avoiding major disputes? How do we answer the objection that there is no proof about the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) being essential?
								","
									   This question presents important issues that require an explanation, since this is one of the most important fallacies that the enemies of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) present. We would like to draw your attention to a few important issues in order to clarify the truth Firstly  Doubting the Imamate of the Ahlulbait just because it is not mentioned in the Holy Book is in reality doubting the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) and belittling his position in being an essential source of religious laws and a speaker of the truth, which in turn raises a big question on the credibility of Islam as a religion and the Holy book as a divine text that “falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it,” as the Quran states clearly. But rather, the Quran itself presents the Messenger of Allah and his conduct as the truth that is not associated with any falsehood, misguidance and forgetfulness. This is explicitly mentioned in the Holy Quran, when the Almighty stated, “Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired,” (Quran 53 3-4) and “whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids, abstain (from it),” (Quran 7 59) and also, “But nay, by thy Lord, they will not have (true) faith until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decides, and submit with full submission.”(Quran 65 4) Based on this, a Muslim should research about Imamate as well as the position of the Sunnah in its regards, just as he looks for the position of the Sunnah with respect to the religious obligations like the prayers, the fast, pilgrimage and the like, as these essential obligations are not mentioned in the Holy Book with detail, but the Sunnah explained the ways to perform them. It is sufficient to prove the Imamate by referring to the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis, like the book of al-Bukhari and the book of Muslim and all the authenticated books in which they included narrations of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) that refer in a clear way to the leadership of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) after the Prophet, like when he said  “Whosoever’s master I am, Ali is his master.” Also  “Ali is your wali (leader) after me.” And also, when he said to Ali (peace be upon him)  “You are to me like Aaron was to Moses, but there is no prophet after me,” and the like in innumerable narrations. There are other narrations that relate to the religious authority of the Ahlubait (peace be upon them) in general, like  “I am leaving among you two weighty things  the Book of Allah and my household; as long as you are attached to them both, you shall never be misguided.”Secondly  there are verses of the Holy Quran which, as the narrations indicate, were revealed in respect of Imam Ali (peace be upon him). They are narrated by Sunni Muslims. They also indicate in a clear way the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon them) like when Almighty Allah said, “Your guardian can be only Allah, and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the alms, while they bow down (in prayer).” (Quran 55 5) And even the verse, “Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you with authority.” (Quran 59 4) They indicate in a clear way that those in authority whose obedience is necessary are infallible since – based on the verse – one should obey them as one obeys Almighty Allah and likewise the Messenger of Allah, and nobody fulfills this condition except the Imams of the Ahlulbait, whom Almighty Allah purified with a thorough purification as per the verse 33 33. Furthermore, Muslims have unanimously agreed on the righteousness of the Imams of the Ahlulbait, their highness, the strength in their faith, their knowledge in the affairs of religion, as this clearly appears to the individual who looks at their history and biography. Could any Muslim accept that Almighty Allah would order Muslims to obey those in authority by applying this title on anyone that assumes power, whether he does this by force or through inheritance, even if he committed the most heinous of crimes like Yazid bin Mu’awiyah and similar despots? Are the aforementioned verses not sufficient in proving the Imamate of the Ahlulbait from the Quran for the fair-minded searcher for the truth?Thirdly  What you have mentioned – that if the Holy Quran had named Imam Ali (peace be upon him) clearly as the successor to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) there would be no conflict between Muslims – is not correct. There are a number of verses that clearly describe certain rulings, and, despite that, Muslims did not agree on them; an example of such a case is the verse of ablution in which the way of performing ablution has been clearly explained, and there is no doubt that the verse is clear in its meaning when it was revealed, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) used to perform wudhu repeatedly in the presence of Muslims. Despite all this, there was a difference in opinion in understanding it. Another example is the verses of divorce which indicate that the three consecutive divorces pronounced in one place and time is not considered as three divorces – by which a man cannot return to the wife – but some Muslim jurists regard this type of divorce as valid and a man cannot return to his wife thereafter. There are many other such examples in jurisprudential issues, although all Muslims base their conclusions on the Holy Book. Furthermore, if one looks in the biography of the Prophet, he could clearly conclude that some of his companions were not obeying him or even respecting him properly. They used to dare to disobey him and not care about his orders; it is sufficient to mention some incidents from the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis  (1) Most of the Muslims fled from a number of battles that were led by the Messenger of Allah, like Uhud, Hunayn and Khaybar, whereas the Holy Book states clearly the prohibition to do so and that whoever does so will be punished in Hell for eternity. Almighty Allah said  “Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.”(Quran 16 8) (2) What took place during the “tragedy of Thursday”  Abdullah bin Abbas – as it is narrated in the Sunni books of narrations like the Musnad of Ahmad – said, weeping, “The day of Thursday! And what day was Thursday!! The Messenger of Allah said to us  “Bring to me a broad bone [to be used to write on] and ink, so I may write for you something that you shall not be misguided after it is written.” Umar said  “The Messenger of Allah is incoherent.” In some of the narrations, they were arguing; some of them were in favor of Umar and some others were saying, “Bring for the Messenger of Allah what he asked for.” The Messenger of Allah said then  “Leave me!! There should not be a fight in my presence.” From the said incident one can conclude that the refusal of the Prophet to write what he wanted to write was to preserve the dignity of Prophethood, since it is not appropriate for the Prophet to order for something in a clear and direct way and Muslim differ in their opinions whether to obey him or not, since there should be no dispute after the order has been issued. From this, one can conclude the reason why the name of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was not mentioned in the Holy Book; Almighty Allah knew that there were some people who wanted to rule and were ready to disobey Allah and His Messenger in an open way, and they had their supporters who were willing to help and encourage them. If the Holy Quran was to mention Imam Ali’s name, then they would doubt the Holy Book in the same way as they have doubted the Messenger of Allah. This would result in the rejection or alteration of the Holy Book.

									   What is the relevance of the concept of Wilayat (authority) of the Imams in our lives today?
								","
									   We can comment on your question by stating the following  1. The Imamate of the Imams (peace be upon them) has been legislated by Almighty Allah for people to observe. Every Muslim must obey all that has been proven to be divinely legislated obligations without considering the immediate benefit of the law on his everyday life since believing in a religion is believing in all what is proven to be part of it. 2. Believing in the Wilayat of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is following them and observing their teachings. This has a great effect on the way a believer deals with day-to-day matters based on the teachings and the guidelines that originate from them. We can see that amongst the characteristics of the followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) by which they are known today is their condemnation of terrorism and tyranny against innocents, especially children, women and old people, and this is not but a reflection of their attachment with the humane teachings of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them).

									   I am interested to know what the Muslim faith thinks of the Catholic faith in particular Jesus, Mary, the mother of god and the holy bible. As your faith is widely misconceived
								","
									   Thank you for your communication with us about important and sensitive subjects that relates to the main catholic beliefs. We admire your way in approaching us to learn about the truth from a reliable Islamic source. We advise you to recite the Quran, and refer to it to learn about Muslim beliefs as it is their holy book and they believe in it with total conviction.
Muslimsâ€™ belief in the divine existence of God is based on proofs and evidences mentioned in a clear way in the Holy Book. They believe that God is one, and He is all surrounding things. He holds all the attributes of goodness. The last two verses from the 59th chapter refer to this when Almighty Allah said  â€œHe is Allah, other than Whom there is no other Allah, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. () He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wiseâ€<U+009D>.
When man explores the greatness of this universe â€“ by learning and searching using the modern means, in such a way that is very amazing way, it becomes very clear that Almighty Allahâ€™s greatness, capability and encompassing are in an absolute measure and beyond imagination when He created this huge universe with this perfection from nothingness. This, by itself, is sufficient to prove the greatness of the Lord and His absolute capability and wisdom.
Jesus is mentioned in the holy Quran numerous times with respect and appreciation, as he is one of the righteous slaves of God whom He sent unto mankind to guide them to believe in monotheism and to obey His orders and to propagate them. Verses 45-51 from the 3rd chapter refers to this truth when Almighty God said  â€<U+009D>(And remember) when the angels said  O Mary! Lo! Allah gives thee glad tidings of a Word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (unto Allah).() He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of the righteous. () She said  My Lord! How can I have a child when no man hath touched me? He said  So (it will be). Allah creates what He wills. If He decrees a thing, He saith unto it only  Be! and it is.() And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel, () And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying)  Lo! I come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers. ()And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. () Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.â€<U+009D>
Mary was a righteous woman; Almighty Allah took special care of her when He made one of His great prophets, Zachariah, as her guardian. She was mentioned in the holy Quran numerously like when Almighty Allah said in verses 35-37 from the 3rd chapter   â€<U+009D>(Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said  My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my womb as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! () And when she was delivered she said  My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast. () And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said  O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)? She answered  It is from Allah. Allah gives without measure to whom He will.â€<U+009D>
The Holy Quran mentioned the birth of Jesus, the son of Mary, and how it was by Godâ€™s order and not in a usual way of creating the human being, as Mary gave birth to Jesus without marriage as a virgin. She was facing the accusations of the society and mischief makers of committing the sin; but the Almighty Lord proved her innocence when her noble son Jesus spoke in his first hours. This was one of Godâ€™s miracles and implementation of Godâ€™s will in a direct way by giving birth to this blessed child. Verses 16-35 from chapter 19, Chapter of Mary, explain this incident when Almighty Allah said â€<U+009D> And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, () And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man () She said  Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing. () He said  I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son () She said  How can I have a son when no man hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? () He said  So (it will be). Thy Lord saith  It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. () And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. () And the pains of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said  Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! () Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying  Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, () And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee () So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say  Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and I will not speak this day to any man. () Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said  O Mary! Thou hast come with a string thing. () O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. () Then she pointed to him. They said  How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? () He spake  Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, () And hath made me blessed whosesoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, () And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. () Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! () Such was Jesus, son of Mary  (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. () It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only  Be! and it is. ()â€<U+009D>
The Bible is amongst the godly revealed books which are mentioned in the holy Quran in many verses. Its aim was to clarify the religious truths and the divine religion of Allah which Jesus brought from Almighty Allah. Verse 46 from chapter 5 refers to this in a clear way when Almighty Lord said  â€œAnd We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).â€<U+009D>
Finally we ask the Lord, the Beneficent to guide us all to His right path.","Hakeem","woman,wife,female,female,marriage,mother","woman,wife,female,female,marriage,mother"

									   What is Irfan? And could you please give your opinion about it?
								","
									   ‘Irfan’ is a word derived from ‘Ma’rifah’, which is the personal cognizance and understanding that affects the self. It has become a term for certain ideas related to the universe and existence in general, and to God, His attributes and His names. On the other hand, ‘irfan’ has the objective of the purification of one's self, and may entail claims of discoveries and observations beyond the usual capabilities and perceptions of humans. Some might consider this knowledge to be similar to divine revelation, so it may cause one to fall into dangers, as one may then not be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Indeed, because of this, many have fallen into clear violations of the Sharia. This has been one of the reasons of misguidance, until it reached the level that religious obligations were dropped and the mention of God in the heart was considered to be sufficient without the need to perform the religious obligations. Hence, it is necessary for the believers to beware of getting into this field without discernment. Instead, they should adhere to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah, which emphasize acting upon the Sharia duties which are related to the relationship with God, like prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, zakat, etc., as well as those obligations related to social duties, such as being dutiful to parents, having good relationships with relatives, having good communication and empathy with other believers, giving sufficient attention to family members, with due regard to their rights and raising them in a proper way, and other obligations that are explained in books of religious jurisprudence. The Islamic sources have emphasized the performance of religious acts in a particular prescribed way, so the believer can fulfil his religious responsibilities. They also recommend various voluntary acts of worship to allow us to get closer to God and to lead to our good deeds gaining divine acceptance. The Islamic sources have also emphasized non-reliance on this world and to not be overly concerned about it, and they have explained that the world is a temporary abode and we are on a short journey through it. They say that one should equip himself in this finite world with good deeds and high morals, and only this can be an asset to take to the next world and ensure one’s eternal happiness, amongst the righteous followers and the Prophets and Imams (peace be upon them). The Islamic sources have also given emphasis on the importance of exhortation and remembrance of the Hereafter, and reflection on the demise of the world and its manifestations. One should not become negligent or forgetful of this. Thus, the values and ideals are enriched in himself and his soul will no longer pay attention to the world and its delusions that lead to sins and wrongdoings. Believers are advised to give due attention to the recitation of the Quran and the supplications narrated from the Prophet and his household (peace be upon them all), as well as their advice and teachings. All of these have a great impact in raising the soul and purifying it from vices; and before all of this, believers are urged to rely on Almighty Allah and seek His mercy and grace, which will lead to their guidance and protection from sins and evil. Almighty Allah said  “And whosoever places his trust in Allah, He will suffice him.” He also said  “As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and surely Allah is with the good-doers.""

									   Are the rules of Sharia only valid for Muslims? Is it allowed for an Islamic country to enforce Non-Muslim women to wear hijab, for example?
								","
									   Almighty Allah made the religious laws of worship, like praying and fasting, and other laws like the obligation of wearing hijab and the prohibition of consuming wine, general to all mankind. The Muslim that does not obey the Almighty Allah in observing one or more of those laws will be punished for this disobedience. Non-Muslims will be punished because of their refusal to believe in Almighty Allah and His Messenger (Peace be upon him. If the non-Muslim can present an acceptable justification for his refusal to believe, then this justification will also apply even more so for his disobedience of Allah Almighty. If he cannot present a justification before Almighty Allah for his refusal to believe, he would have a lesser chance to do so for not observing the Sharia laws.
It is the responsibility of the infallible Imam to implement and apply the Islamic laws on non-Muslims, as he is the most knowledgeable in implementing the Godly obligations.

									   The Prophetâ€™s (peace be upon him and his progeny) marriage to Aisha is looked at by the enemies of Islam as a negative episode in the Prophetâ€™s life, using the current cultural view about the age of the wife. This cultural view about the success of the marriage and personal life of the wife when she marries at a later age is a result of our modern time and its complications, and did not exist during that time nor did it exist during later eras.
Anyhow, a researcher will see that history did not reflect that she was forced into the marriage. All this shows that what the enemies of Islam present as a negative side in the personality of the Prophet is not based on a realistic foundation. It is, rather, using an old incident that took place during totally different social circumstances and judging it based on a modern view of marriage.","Hakeem","marriage,wife,marriage,wife,marriage,marriage","marriage,wife,marriage,wife,marriage,marriage"
