									Question : Is it permissible for non-Shias to make use of your edicts without becoming Shia Muslims?
								","
									Answer : Our edicts are based on the teachings of the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) through the narrations that reached us in reliable ways, which all Muslims are required to act upon. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) ordered the nation of Islam to refer to the Ahlulbait and follow them in the famous well-known narration that is reported by numerous ways in the books of Shias and Sunnis: ""I leave among you the two weighty things: the Book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you follow both of them, you will never be misguided."" Acting upon this narration, as well as other similar narrations, to follow the AhlulBait is not obligatory on the Shias only, but it is an obligation on all Muslims.

									Question : If I am in the taql<U+012B>d of a certain marja, should I follow him only on Sharia matters or all matters?
								","
									Answer : It is obligatory on the individual to refer to the marja in learning about the religious rulings and implementing them in the matters of his worships, dealings, family relations and relations with other people, since the sharia has rulings and guidance for all issues that one could run into. In other aspects of life, the marja is referred to as an advisor since he has knowledge on the Holy Quran and the teachings of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them).

									Question : When one is starting taql<U+012B>d and is choosing a marja, how does one make a decision? Is it obligatory to follow the most knowledgeable? What if there are maraja who say that it is not obligatory to follow the most knowledgeable?
								","
									Answer : When a person starts emulating a marja after he realizes his responsibility in observing the rulings of the Sharia, he refers to the basic logic that every sane person will arrive at, and upon which one will be responsible to act in accordance to. There is no doubt that this logic obligates the ignorant to refer to the knowledgeable in what the latter knows. As the knowledgeable in the religious sciences (i.e. the mujtahids) differ in their views in various religious rulings, including their view in following the most knowledgeable, it becomes necessary to follow the edicts of one of them based on a distinguished characteristic that others do not possess, which is being the most knowledgeable. Although the views of some of the mujtahids do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, but in order to assure that we fulfil our responsibility of observing the Sharia with certainty, the initial logical ruling leads to following the edicts of the most knowledgeable in the issue of referring to the most knowledgeable mujtahid. This is so because the view of mujtahids who do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable allow following the most knowledgeable. To the contrary, the views of those who necessitate following the most knowledgeable do not allow following any mujtahid other than the most knowledgeable. In other words, following the most knowledgeable is obligatory according to some and permissible according to others, whereas not following the most knowledgeable is permissible according to some and prohibited according to others. It is natural then to follow the most knowledgeable in this issue. If his view – in this issue – necessitates following the most knowledgeable, one should follow him in the rest of his views. If his view does not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, then one can follow another mujtahid.

									Question : If one is not aware of the differences between marja's opinions on a particular ruling, and does not know the verdict of his own marja, can he follow the edict of another marja'?
								","
									Answer : If one is aware that there are differences between the maraja's in the rulings that affect him, which is usually the case, then he must observe precaution. Since this is not practical for many to do so, he must find the most knowledgeable from them and follow him.

									Question : If a person commits an act which his marja deems to be prohibited, and on Judgment Day it is discovered that the act was not actually a sin after all, will this person not be punished for it since the act was not prohibited? Or will he get punished because he disobeyed the edict of his marja?
								","
									Answer : The said person is not considered as disobedient, but is liable for proceeding to commit an act that he was informed to be a sin. An example of this is if a person drinks from a glass thinking it to be wine, but it turns out to be water.

									Question : What is the age of religiously recognized adulthood (bulugh)?
								","
									Answer : Religious adulthood is recognized for the male by any of the following three signs, whichever happen first: 1. The presence of hard hair on his face or in the pubic area. 2. The release of semen, whether it was during a wet dream or when awake. 3. The completion of fifteen lunar years. The female reaches adulthood when she completes the age of nine lunar years.

									Question : When I go to study in the Islamic seminary of Najaf, what do I have to study to become a mujtahid?
								","
									Answer : A believer should aim to fulfill the religious responsibilities of upholding the orders of the Sharia; one of them is learning the Islamic laws and teaching them. This could be achieved by learning more about the religion – and not necessarily reaching the level of ijtihad – by which a believer could serve Islam. One could serve the religion and be a role model amongst his society, family and friends by being obedient to the Islamic laws and by spreading the religious teachings in the areas where he resides. Therefore, ijtihad is not a goal that a student should have from the beginning. Ijtihad is a talent that can be achieved by studying and with the guidance of Almighty Allah. A student of Islamic studies should study hard and make use of his time as much as possible. If he achieves this, then he can thank Almighty Allah for this bounty. If he does not, he can still serve the religion.

									Question : I came across many authentic traditions of the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) about ghusl, purification and ablution. These traditions are highly descriptive and specific about the main issues in jurisprudence. Is it permissible for me to follow my understanding of these traditions, and follow the rulings of my marja in other issues?
								","
									Answer : You should follow the scholar who has reached the level of ijtihad and fulfills all the other conditions of the marja in all issues. The derivation of the edicts from the religious sources require a great amount of knowledge and experience gained from continuous studying and research over many years. The authenticity of the traditions is only one factor taken into consideration in this process. Only the scholars who have reached the level of ijtihad have the capability to undertake this.

									Question : Do mujtahids differ in the laws of the prayer? For example one tells us to pray this way and another tells us to pray another way?
								","
									Answer : It is natural to have different derivations, as people differ in their understanding of a single text, whereas the mujtahids deal with numerous texts, plus the fact that as time passes further away from the time of the texts, fallacies and probabilities increase. From this, the mission of a mujtahid becomes harder and his responsibility becomes greater in protecting the religion in a correct way and to the greatest possible extent. The oppressors and the liars throughout the times have made obstacles for us in obtaining the truths from the Imams (peace be upon them) which made the mission of the mujtahids more difficult. Therefore some variations are to be expected, in all areas of jurisprudence.

									Question : According to another marja synthetic alcohol is tahir and it is allowed to use perfume containing such alcohol; however, Sayyid Al-Hakeem considers all types of alcohol as najis. Both of them are marjas of taqleed, so why are their edicts different?
								","
									Answer : The difference in deriving the laws between religious jurists naturally originates from their difference in understanding the religious texts or considering some of them over the others. His Eminence, Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) sees that alcohol is najis, if it is an intoxicant and naturally liquid. Based on this, the prayer is invalid if the praying person’s body or clothes came in contact with it.

"14","
									Question : I have heard that if a person fails to do taqleed, all of his good deeds will be invalidated, no matter how virtuous a devotee he may be. Is this true?
								","
									Answer : The individual – who has not reached the level of ijtihad, nor does he act on precaution between the edicts of the mujtahids – cannot guarantee the correctness of his deeds before Almighty Allah, unless they correspond to the edicts of a religious scholar who is an expert in Islamic jurisprudence, i.e. a mujtahid. Referring to the expert will relieve him from liability if the edicts of the mujtahid do not conform to the actual legislated laws of Allah Almighty. Without following the expert mujtahid, the person will be held responsible before The Almighty if the actions and transactions were not really in accordance to the religion.

								","
									Answer : You can change your marja by starting to refer to the edicts of the new marja and acting upon them. However, the change is permissible only if it is based on religious evidence, for example, when it is proven to you that the new marja is more knowledgeable than the current one.

									Question : Is it permissible to change my taqleed in a particular issue because the edict of the marja I am following causes hardship for me?
								","
									Answer : It is not permissible to switch from a mujtahid to another just because the second mujtahid's edict is easier to follow or pleases the individual more. The first marja must be followed as long as he is still fulfills all the conditions of the marja. However, if the marja that you are following has an obligatory precaution, then you can follow another qualified marja in that issue.

A trusted person told me that a particular Marja was amongst the most knowledgeable Mujtahids, and I began following him although I was not certain that He was the most knowledgeable. Is my taqleed valid?
								","
									Answer : If it has been proven to you via religious evidence that there are Marjas who are more knowledgeable than the Marja that you used to follow, you should refrain from following the latter and search for the most knowledgeable amongst those Marjas.

									Question : Is the act of emulation (taqleed) obligatory? If yes, then kindly give me a reference from the Quran?
								","
									Answer : Taqleed is an obligation based on intellect. Muslims are required to implement the laws of the Islamic religion, and they cannot be known in details and in a correct way except by referring to the people of expertise, who are the religious scholars and relying on them in their findings that they concluded by research and study. Evidence of this concept from the Holy Quran is when Almighty Allah said: “And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may gain sound knowledge in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they may beware.”(Qur'an, 122:9).

									Question : What is the ruling about someone who does not emulate a mujtahid?
								","
									Answer : Emulation (taql<U+012B>d) is a necessity when a lay believer faces a situation where he does not know the correct religious ruling, as he is supposed to refer to the expert to get the proper answer. Otherwise, without referring to the expert and implementing the ruling, he would be liable for the mistake, whereas he will not be liable when he refers to the expert, even if the latter made a mistake. Taql<U+012B>d secures a layperson from liability before the Almighty Allah.

									Question : The concept of (taqleed) has been popular recently. I am not convinced of its religious obligation. Can you help me?
								","
									Answer : The popularity of the concept of (taqleed) amongst the masses in these days is due to the broad existence of means of communication which have led to the wide spread of knowledge of religious laws. It is not because the concept is new. Rather, it was present at the time of the Imams (peace be upon them) when they were directing their companions and followers, in general, to learn the religious laws. This naturally led to many people asking questions about their affairs, and it was not practical for all of them to reach the Imam (peace be upon him) and ask him in person, so they used to refer to his close companions who could be reached to gain knowledge in religious laws. There were known narrators who were giving edicts to people and the Shias used to refer to them during those days, like Muhammad bin Muslim, Zurarah, Zakariyya bin Adam and others. This need continued to exist after the occultation of the Twelfth Imam (peace be upon him) until now. It is a natural need and a sensible process, as people refer to the experts in various fields like medicine, engineering and other kinds of expertise, as people are not satisfied with their own limited knowledge in these areas.

									Answer : The ahl-ul-khibrah are those who can recognize the most knowledgeable by his writings, research and edicts. Those experts can be reached through communicating with the Howza. If such communication is not possible or determining the most knowledgeable is not possible, one is required to choose one of the scholars who have reached the level of ijtihad and fulfil the conditions of being a marja, and follow him. The chosen should be the most God-fearing amongst them if possible. Otherwise, the believer can choose one of them and follow his verdicts.

									Question : These days people have been saying that they do not do ""blind"" taqleed, and they follow those rules of a marja which are not against the Quran or the narrations, and they reject those which are against them. Is this a correct method?
								","
									Answer : The emulation that Shias do is not blind taqleed. It is, rather, based on vision and wisdom, since everybody is asked to observe the Sharia and act upon its obligations and refrain from what it prohibits; and at the same time, a normal Muslim does not possess the specialized capabilities to know the laws of the religion. It becomes natural for those who are not experts in this field to refer to the jurist who specializes in deriving the rulings of the Sharia after exerting great efforts in order to reach religious conclusions. Taql<U+012B>d is commonly practiced by people all the time, when they refer – in the aspects that require expert knowledge and scientific efforts – to those who specialize in the specific fields, like medical doctors and engineers, and they act upon their findings and conclusions. Moreover, the Holy Quran and the Sunnah hold a central position in the process of derivation of the mujtahid, so naturally the rulings of a mujtahid – who fulfills the conditions of being a marja' – will not be against them. Therefore, bearing all this mind, it is not within the non-expert Muslim's domain to judge a mujtahid's edicts, otherwise his judgment will be without any base.

Committing small sins without insistence does not affect it. Adalah – as a condition in the marja – is a high level of God-fearing which leads the person to refraining from disobeying the religious laws and committing sins – whether the sins are small or major. If on the rare occasion he commits a sin, he would rush to repent to Almighty Allah and seek his forgiveness. A person who holds 'ad<U+0101>lah is called ""adil"".

									Answer : If the mujtahids are equal in knowledge or you are not able to determine the most knowledgeable amongst them, and if observing precaution – to guarantee that the religious obligations are fulfilled – is not a possibility, one must choose the most God-fearing amongst the most knowledgeable mujtahids.

Referring to the expert will relieve him from liability if the edicts of the mujtahid do not conform to the actual legislated laws of Allah Almighty.

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) ordered the nation of Islam to refer to the Ahlulbait and follow them in the famous well-known narration that is reported by numerous ways in the books of Shias and Sunnis: ""I leave among you the two weighty things: the Book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you follow both of them, you will never be misguided.""

									Question : When I go to study in the Islamic seminary of Najaf, what do I have to study to become a mujtahid?
								","
									Answer : A believer should aim to fulfill the religious responsibilities of upholding the orders of the Sharia; one of them is learning the Islamic laws and teaching them. This could be achieved by learning more about the religion – and not necessarily reaching the level of ijtihad – by which a believer could serve Islam. One could serve the religion and be a role model amongst his society, family and friends by being obedient to the Islamic laws and by spreading the religious teachings in the areas where he resides. Therefore, ijtihad is not a goal that a student should have from the beginning. Ijtihad is a talent that can be achieved by studying and with the guidance of Almighty Allah. A student of Islamic studies should study hard and make use of his time as much as possible. If he achieves this, then he can thank Almighty Allah for this bounty. If he does not, he can still serve the religion.

									Question : I came across many authentic traditions of the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) about ghusl, purification and ablution.

Is it permissible for me to follow my understanding of these traditions, and follow the rulings of my marja in other issues?
								","
									Answer : You should follow the scholar who has reached the level of ijtihad and fulfills all the other conditions of the marja in all issues. The derivation of the edicts from the religious sources require a great amount of knowledge and experience gained from continuous studying and research over many years. The authenticity of the traditions is only one factor taken into consideration in this process. Only the scholars who have reached the level of ijtihad have the capability to undertake this.

									Question : Do mujtahids differ in the laws of the prayer? For example one tells us to pray this way and another tells us to pray another way?
								","
									Answer : It is natural to have different derivations, as people differ in their understanding of a single text, whereas the mujtahids deal with numerous texts, plus the fact that as time passes further away from the time of the texts, fallacies and probabilities increase. From this, the mission of a mujtahid becomes harder and his responsibility becomes greater in protecting the religion in a correct way and to the greatest possible extent. The oppressors and the liars throughout the times have made obstacles for us in obtaining the truths from the Imams (peace be upon them) which made the mission of the mujtahids more difficult. Therefore some variations are to be expected, in all areas of jurisprudence.

									Question : According to another marja synthetic alcohol is tahir and it is allowed to use perfume containing such alcohol; however, Sayyid Al-Hakeem considers all types of alcohol as najis. Both of them are marjas of taqleed, so why are their edicts different?
								","
									Answer : The difference in deriving the laws between religious jurists naturally originates from their difference in understanding the religious texts or considering some of them over the others. His Eminence, Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) sees that alcohol is najis, if it is an intoxicant and naturally liquid. Based on this, the prayer is invalid if the praying person’s body or clothes came in contact with it.

So, it is natural for scientists to arrive at different conclusions as long as they are thinking freely and objectively. As such, the Shia school of jurisprudence has developed as a result of the intellectual efforts of many great scholars throughout centuries, may Almighty Allah shower His blessings over their souls and guard those still amongst us, for their preservation of the religion from external influences and powers and maintained the religion in its pure and untainted form.

									Question : What is the wisdom behind having so many Marjas instead of just having one?
								","
									Answer : Referring to the religious jurists in finding the rulings of the Sharia is one of concepts which have certain limitations and conditions, for which one must refer to the religious legislator, Almighty Allah. The religious texts explain the general qualities of the scholars whom one should refer to. This concept was implemented during the time of the Imams (peace be upon them) themselves, who guided the believers to refer to certain scholars amongst the disciples in various parts of the Muslim world. The followers of the Ahlulbait continued for the subsequent generations to refer to the scholars who fulfilled the criteria described by the Imams (peace be upon them). Since there are more than one scholar who fulfills these qualities, the individual should refer to the one who is most knowledgeable, and determining this is a subjective task for each individual. Therefore, the believers will naturally come to different conclusions and have different Marjas to follow.

									Question : When a person has gas incontinence, is he supposed to perform one wudhu for every prayer? Or can he perform one wudhu for two prayers if they are performed together one after the other?
								","
									Answer : If he has a specific period in which he can perform the wudhu and the prayer without passing wind, he should wait for it and perform the wudhu and prayer within this period.If he does not have such a period, then he should perform the ablution before the prayer and offer the prayer, and when he passes wind during the prayer, he should suspend the prayer and perform the wudhu and continue where he stopped. Based on an obligatory precaution he should not do anything that invalidates the prayer when performing this wudhu, such as talking and the like. However, in such a situation if one does anything that conflicts with the form of the prayer or turns away from Qibla, for the purposes of performing wudhu, it will not invalidate the prayer. If one has such a condition, he should make appropriate preparations to ensure that the acts of wudhu during the prayer are minimal.

Based on an obligatory precaution he should not do anything that invalidates the prayer when performing this wudhu, such as talking and the like. However, in such a situation if one does anything that conflicts with the form of the prayer or turns away from Qibla, for the purposes of performing wudhu, it will not invalidate the prayer.

									Question : A patient is going to have surgery to remove the bladder because of cancer.

									Answer : One should observe the taharah of the clothes during the prayer as the prayer is void with najis clothes. With respect to wudhu, you can perform the prayer at a time the urine is not released from you, even by delaying it to the end of the prescribed time - but not beyond it - and even if you shorten the prayers by omitting the second chapter after al-Fatiha and by omitting the recommended acts of the prayer. If this is not possible, then it is permissible to offer the prayer even with the release of the urine but one should join the Dhuhr and Asr prayers with one wudhu, and similarly the Maghrib and Isha prayers with one wudhu.

								","

Because of corruption, badness and evilness in certain things or acts, He commanded us to refrain from them and made them prohibited. Similarly, because of benefits and goodness in certain other things, He ordered us to perform them and made them obligatory on us. Some of these laws are general and apply to all people, all the time, and anywhere.The ability of the human being is limited, so is unable to find out and understand the reasons behind the Sharia of Almighty Allah. Sometimes Allah Almighty has taught us through the Holy Prophet and the Imams (peace be upon them), the wisdom behind certain few rulings. We must obey His laws by refraining from the prohibited acts and undertaking the obligatory acts, even if we do not know the reason behind each and every one of them.The najasah of the dog is one of the rulings about which we do not know the wisdom behind.

									Question : My father was born and lived a fair portion of his life in a Middle-Eastern village. He then moved to another close-by village (which is less than 22 km from the first village), where he lived, worked, got married and built a house. He then moved to Canada where he has been living for many years. I was born in Canada and sometimes come to Lebanon to visit for a few months every few years.

The Maraji have various edicts on this, which has led to some confusion and doubts in regards to Marja’iyyah and the concept of Taqleed. To remedy this, is it possible for the Maraji to get together to reach one conclusion and one edict on this issue?
								","
									Answer : What has happened in recent years is because of the differences in the ijtihad and in interpretations of the sources and narrations from the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Some religious authorities – including his Eminence Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) – have the opinion that the narrations from the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) prove that most countries can have one Eid in such a way that if the crescent was seen in a country, it is sufficient to establish Eid in other countries as well, even if the distance between the two countries is relatively far. The details of the verdict of his Eminence are explained in his books of Islamic Laws. However, some other Maraji have the opinion that seeing the crescent in a country will prove it to be the night of Eid for other countries only if they share a horizon, so such sighting does not necessarily prove the Eid in other distant countries. If the differences in the edicts originate from the differences in Ijtihad and understanding of religious texts, then it is unavoidable, since a Mujtahid cannot change his opinions that are based on his own Ijtihad and research simply because of social pressure or similar reasons that are not related to what the religious texts indicate as per his understanding. As a matter of fact, doing so is considered as compromising against his duties in finding religious realities. Differences of these types indicate the authenticity of the Shia sect, and the piety and sincerity of its followers. The Marja’ tries his best – via his research and teaching – to reach the religious realities. At the same time, the believers try their best to find out the most knowledgeable Mujtahid who fulfills all the criteria of the Marja’ and to act upon his edicts. This shows the strength of faith that these two groups possess. Difference in opinions should not lead to conflicts or aversion. It should rather be dealt with calmness and wisdom for the sake of unity and the general interests of the believers.

If there is no such certainty, then one should assume that the month is continuing until the completion of thirty days.

									Question : I have noticed a great commotion in regards to moon sighting issues. The Maraji have various edicts on this, which has led to some confusion and doubts in regards to Marja’iyyah and the concept of Taqleed. To remedy this, is it possible for the Maraji to get together to reach one conclusion and one edict on this issue?
								","
									Answer : What has happened in recent years is because of the differences in the ijtihad and in interpretations of the sources and narrations from the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Some religious authorities – including his Eminence Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) – have the opinion that the narrations from the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) prove that most countries can have one Eid in such a way that if the crescent was seen in a country, it is sufficient to establish Eid in other countries as well, even if the distance between the two countries is relatively far. The details of the verdict of his Eminence are explained in his books of Islamic Laws. However, some other Maraji have the opinion that seeing the crescent in a country will prove it to be the night of Eid for other countries only if they share a horizon, so such sighting does not necessarily prove the Eid in other distant countries. If the differences in the edicts originate from the differences in Ijtihad and understanding of religious texts, then it is unavoidable, since a Mujtahid cannot change his opinions that are based on his own Ijtihad and research simply because of social pressure or similar reasons that are not related to what the religious texts indicate as per his understanding. As a matter of fact, doing so is considered as compromising against his duties in finding religious realities. Differences of these types indicate the authenticity of the Shia sect, and the piety and sincerity of its followers. The Marja’ tries his best – via his research and teaching – to reach the religious realities. At the same time, the believers try their best to find out the most knowledgeable Mujtahid who fulfills all the criteria of the Marja’ and to act upon his edicts. This shows the strength of faith that these two groups possess. Difference in opinions should not lead to conflicts or aversion. It should rather be dealt with calmness and wisdom for the sake of unity and the general interests of the believers.

If the sighting of the new moon has not been established, but there is certainty derived from scientific calculations that the new moon has reached the level where it is possible to be seen by the naked eye, then one should act upon that too.

									Question : Please could you explain why it has become widely circulated that the Shias pay the Khums, while the payment of Zakat is not common amongst them, although I know that they are both equally obligatory?
								","
									Answer : Zakat is among the obligations that have been emphasized by the Holy Quran and the traditions of the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Not paying it is considered among the major sins for which Allah has promised hellfire. The jurists have explained the conditions and rulings about Zakat in their books. Zakat is obligatory on the following three groups of properties: (1) Gold and silver minted coins. (2) The four crops: wheat, barley, raisins and dates. (3) The four livestock: camels, cows, goats and sheep. Gold and silver coins are not used as tender nowadays, so the Zakat on this group does not apply. The Zakat on the other items are not obligatory unless their quantity reaches a particular threshold, which most people do not possess nowadays. One can see that the application of obligatory Zakat is much less than Khums, which is obligatory on all net income, as Allah has said: “And know that whatever thing you gain, indeed a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the Messenger and for the kinsman and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer” (8:41).The condition of the obligation of Khums, which is the existence of a net income, applies to almost everybody, however little it may be.

									Question : Please could you explain why it has become widely circulated that the Shias pay the Khums, while the payment of Zakat is not common amongst them, although I know that they are both equally obligatory?
								","
									Answer : Zakat is among the obligations that have been emphasized by the Holy Quran and the traditions of the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Not paying it is considered among the major sins for which Allah has promised hellfire. The jurists have explained the conditions and rulings about Zakat in their books. Zakat is obligatory on the following three groups of properties: (1) Gold and silver minted coins. (2) The four crops: wheat, barley, raisins and dates. (3) The four livestock: camels, cows, goats and sheep. Gold and silver coins are not used as tender nowadays, so the Zakat on this group does not apply. The Zakat on the other items are not obligatory unless their quantity reaches a particular threshold, which most people do not possess nowadays. One can see that the application of obligatory Zakat is much less than Khums, which is obligatory on all net income, as Allah has said: “And know that whatever thing you gain, indeed a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the Messenger and for the kinsman and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer” (8:41).The condition of the obligation of Khums, which is the existence of a net income, applies to almost everybody, however little it may be. On the other hand, Zakat is only applicable for those who own at least a particular amount of the mentioned crops and livestock.

									Answer : May Allah accept from you this sincere intention in upholding His teachings and obligations. Khums is a divinely-prescribed obligation. It is the fifth of the yearly income after deducting expenses. It can be calculated as a fifth of all the monies that is in one’s possession plus the fifth of the worth of the items that were unused during the year. This khums amount is divided into two equal amounts: The first one is the share of Sayyids. It should be spent on needy people from the clan of Hashim, the great-grandfather of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). The second one is the share of the Imam (peace be upon him). It should be given to the religious Adil Marji who is able to spend it in accordance to what pleases the twelfth Imam (peace be upon him).

The khums amount is divided into two equal amounts: one is to be given to needy people amongst the offspring of Hashim – the great-grandfather of the Prophet (peace be upon him) – and the second is to be spent with the coordination of the Marja’ by referring to him or his appointed agent to spend it in the ways of serving the religion and fulfilling the necessities of the believers.

Therefore, for the next year $960 will be exempted from khums ($800 from the previous year, plus $160 remaining from the current year).

									Question : I work as an employee in a Government office in India, and some amount from our monthly salary is paid towards a pension fund. This amount remains in their custody and at the disposal of the Government. When the employee retires, the money with interest will be paid back to him. If the employee at some point during his service requires some money from his pension fund, it is paid to him with the condition that he pays it back within a specific timeframe. Now the question is if the employee, during his service period, withdraws some amount from his pension fund account, has he to pay the Khums of this amount immediately considering that it has been there for more than a year?

									Answer : If you did not live in the house until after the end of the khums year, then the khums is the fifth of the house’s value.

								","
									Answer : Yes, this is true; you should determine the beginning of the Khums year, which is a set date ever year. For the past period in which the Khums has not been paid, you will need to agree with your Marji or his agent on an appropriate set date and to calculate the due Khums accordingly. Additional to this, you will need to pay the Khums of all unused items in your possession, include money you have in your hands as cash and what you have saved in the bank. Once the due Khums has been paid, you are left with 80% of the original amount. Khums will not be paid on this 80% remainder again, and you are to calculate the next Khums payment on any further savings at the next set date.

								","
									Answer : There is no khums on the money from which khums was already paid, i.e. the 32,000 Rubles (which is 40,000 minus 8,000 khums). So khums will be paid from 118,000 (which is 150,000 minus 32,000).

									Answer : If the beginning of Muharram is the first day of your khums fiscal year then khums is payable at the end of Dhil-Hijjah, even if you started saving in Dhil-Qa’dah and did not save anything before that. The khums fiscal year begins when one gains any money in his life, even when he was a child.

									Question : I just began to pay khums this year, but I have been a Muslim for over 5 years. How do I calculate how much khums to pay if I do not know how much money I made in the past 5 years?
								","
									Answer : May Allah accept from you this sincere intention in upholding His teachings and obligations. Khums is a divinely-prescribed obligation. It is the fifth of the yearly income after deducting expenses. It can be calculated as a fifth of all the monies that is in one’s possession plus the fifth of the worth of the items that were unused during the year. This khums amount is divided into two equal amounts: The first one is the share of Sayyids. It should be spent on needy people from the clan of Hashim, the great-grandfather of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). The second one is the share of the Imam (peace be upon him). It should be given to the religious Adil Marji who is able to spend it in accordance to what pleases the twelfth Imam (peace be upon him).

My friends are also religious Shia Muslims.My questions are as follows: (1) Even though I am 22 years old, is my father still allowed to not let me leave the house and go out with my friends or run errands? (2) Even though I’m an adult, is it permissible for my father to invade my privacy? (3) Is my father permitted to forcefully make me attend non-religious events?
								","
									Answer : The relationship between a father and his son should be based on mutual respect and love, since the father usually cares about his son and tries to raise him righteously. It is natural that the father watches his son’s behavior and tries to learn about his friends in order to protect him from making mistakes. The son should understand this and appreciate it. With the development of more trust between the two, the following and control decreases gradually when the father sees the good behavior of his son. If the father askes his son to do what does not correspond to the rulings of the Sharia, the son is not obligated to follow him although it is obligatory for the son to deal with his parents with good manners and respect.

									Question : Me and my friend had a fight and we are not talking to each other for the past two years. Someone told me that this is prohibited. Is that true?
								","
									Answer : Based on compulsory precaution, one should not desert a believer for more than three days, even if the latter was wrongful to him. It is sufficient to satisfy this obligation by greeting him (e.g. saying 'salam alaykum'). If the other party insisted on the abandonment, he will become the deserter. This prohibition has three exceptions: First: if the desertion was to forbid the wrong. Second: if the desertion would lead to a benefit that the Sharia recommends, like - for example - if desertion leads to paying attention towards a truth that could remain hidden without such desertion, or similar cases. Third: if the reestablishing the relationship would lead to demeaning oneself. One should be careful in not confusing arrogance and anger with self-demeaning.

									Question : I want to know why temporary marriage is permissible.
								","
									Answer : Muslims have unanimously agreed that temporary marriage was legislated by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). The second caliph stopped people from doing it during his rule at a famous incident. Since it was legislated by the Prophet, it remains lawful and valid. And this is what the followers of the Ahlul-bait (peace be upon him) and a group of the companions of the prophets (peace be upon him) believe.
								"
"1776","
									Question : Some Muslims object to the permissibility of temporary marriage. Can you please provide me with evidence to support its legality?
								","
									Answer : There is no doubt that the temporary marriage is legislated. Proof is present in the Holy Book and the noble traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) which are authenticated in the Sunni and Shia books. What happened after that is that the second Caliph prevented it and its prohibition then became widely accepted amongst the Sunni scholars. What indicates its legislation from the Holy Book is the following verse: â€œIt is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom you seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty."" (24:4) In the book of Nail Al-Awtar, Vol.6, Pg.270, it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas used to recite this verse and he used to add ""by a set time"" after ""And those of whom you seek content"" and this clearly explains the legislation of the temporary marriage. In this same book it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas stated that temporary marriage was a mercy that Almighty Allah has given to his slaves and if it was not the forbidding of Umar, no one would ever need to commit adultery.  In the book of Al-Muhalla, vol. 9, pg. 520, the author, Ibn Hazm, stated: ""The permissibility of temporary marriage after the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) was affirmed by a group of his companions like Asma, the daughter of Abu Bakr, Jabir bin Abdillah, Ibn Masoud, Ibn Abbas, Moawiyah bin Abi Sufyan ""The list continues on until he said: ""and most jurists of the holy city of Mecca"". From this, one can conclude that the disagreement started after the prohibition of Umar and not in its legislation itself.

									Question : I understand that temporary marriage is for pleasure. Does that mean that physical attraction and lust are permissible reasons to enter into such a contract, or are there other prerequisite motivations that one must have before two people can enter into this arrangement?
								","
									Answer : It is permissible to enter into temporary marriage for the sake of pleasure and lust via legislated means and within religious guidelines. Among the benefits of temporary marriage is that it controls sexual relation between the two sexes within specific rules and guidelines; like specifying the duration of the marriage and the dower, serving the waiting period between one marriage and another, and the child born from such a matrimony being legitimate for the couple. There is no doubt that if such marriage was common in the society, committing adultery would be minimal.

If the answer is yes, then can it be said in other words?
								","
									Answer : If the two parties agreed on forming a marriage contract between them in such a way that the paid money is considered as dower like the permanent marriage, then the marriage is valid. If she understands that the relationship allows her to have sexual acts in return for a fee, then it is adultery. The same can be said if she understands the relationship as a form of friendship.

									Answer : The Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) have interpreted the food that is mentioned in the verse: “The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you” to be grains and such food which do not have the requirement of religious slaughtering. Meat is not included in this verse, as it is unlawful to consume it unless some special conditions are met, and there is no doubt that those conditions are not met in the meat in western countries.

									Question : Are the wives of the Prophet included in Ahlulbayt (peace be upon them) according to the 33rd verse of Surah al-Ahzab?
								","
									Answer : The verse does not include the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) since the wife – based on Arabic custom – is not included in the term “household” usually. This term refers to the genealogy of the man and his relatives by blood. It was narrated in the book “Lisan ul-Arab” that Ibn Sayyidah – an expert in Arabic linguistics – stated that the term “ahl” refers to the tribe of the man and his blood relatives. Apparently, this meaning was clear during the first era of Islam, since history did not mention that the aforementioned term is given to the wives by the companions of the Prophet. It was not used by the wives of the Prophet themselves. Aisha – for example – led an army to fight Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and her supporters were trying to gain the support of Muslims by any possible mean. Yet they did not mention that she is a member of the Ahlulbait. It appears from numerous traditions narrated by Muslims in general that the Messenger of Allah used this phrase to refer to Ali, Hasan, Husain and Fatima (peace be upon them). Ahmed bin Hanbal narrated in his book (Al-Musnad) from Umm Salama that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) told Fatima (peace be upon her), “Call for me your husband and your two sons”. She did so, and he then placed a blanket over them and then he placed his hand over them and said: ”O Lord, these are the Aal of Mohammad, so place your blessings on Mohammad and the Aal of Mohammad. All praise and glory belong to you.” Umm Salama raised the blanket to join with them. The Messenger of Allah prevented her and said: “Your future is good”. Many other traditions narrated by Sunni scholars mentioned clearly that the noble verse (33:33) was revealed while they were under the blanket. In addition to that, what some of the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) did clearly indicates that they were not purified from committing sins; some verses of chapter 66 (al-Tahreem) were revealed condemning Aisha and Hafsa since they aided one another against the Messenger of Allah. It was also narrated that one of the Prophet’s wife, Qutaila bint Qais left the religion of Islam after the death of the Prophet and got married to Ikrama bin Abi Jahl.

									Question : We know from verse (33:33) that the Ahlulbait are Imam Ali, Fatimah Hasan and Husain (peace be upon them) and we also know from the hadith the names of the twelve Imams. Can the other offspring of the Imam be considered amongst the Ahlulbait?
								","
									Answer : The verses and the narrations that are reported in the superiority of the Ahlulbait are specific to the five infallibles: The Prophet, Imam Ali, Fatima Al-Zahra, Imam Hasan and Imam Husain (peace be upon them all). Sometimes, one can understand that some religious texts include the rest of the twelve Imams (peace be upon them). This does not include the other offspring of the Imams.

									Question : Some people say that Islam is not something which should be connected with a family, like the family of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they use this for their argument against the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Please comment on this.
								","
									Answer : Our connection to the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is not emotional; rather, it is religious and based on their infallibility. Almighty Allah has ordered us to follow them. He said: ""Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Ahlulbait, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing""(33:33). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered us to follow them. He said: ""I am leaving amongst you the two weighty things, the book of Allah, and my progeny"". In addition to that, there are narrations about each and every one of the Imams of the Ahlulbait specifically. As an example, the Messenger of Allah said: “Ali is your Wali (i.e. guardian) after me” and he said: “Whoever’s master I am, Ali is his master”. These and other religious texts show that these people have special characteristics that enable them to take their position of imamate and leadership. So the issue is not emotional, nor is it based on a tribe or a family. On the other hand, most believers in the Sunni sect accepted the legitimacy of the caliphate of the Umayyads and Abbasids, although both of these states were established and continued on the basis of inheritance and without any entitlement at all.

									Question : Can we supplicate to the Messenger of Allah, the Ahlulbait and the Imams (peace be upon them all)?
								","
									Answer : The Dua (supplication) is a “request”, and since Almighty Allah is in charge of the universe and manages all creations, asking Him is direct. Requesting from others, like the Prophets or the Imams, is not permissible if the seeker considers them as being independent in dealing with his request, aside from Almighty Allah. This is like considering a partner with Almighty Allah. If the believer seeks the intercession of the Prophets and the Imams (peace be upon them) as they can then ask Almighty Allah to fulfill the seeker’s supplication, or he requests from Almighty Allah to fulfill his supplication by referring to the high rank of the noble personalities of the Prophets and the Imams (peace be upon them), then these two kinds of supplications are considered as permissible acts of worship.

								","
									Answer : It was reported in some authentic narrations of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) the emphasis on crying, showing sadness and grief for Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) and establishing the mourning ceremonies for his tragedy and refraining from eating or drinking on the day of Ashura - without the intention of fasting - and breaking it with little water and food after noon. It was reported also to refrain from going out for regular needs on such occasions. It was also reported that whoever goes out to fulfill one of his needs that day, Almighty Allah will not bless it if it was fulfilled. It was also reported the emphasis on presenting grief and sadness for the tragedies of the Ahlulbait in general and there is no doubt that the days of their martyrdoms are the best to do so. From such narrations, one can determine under what category the mentioned examples fit, since some of them are inconsistent with sadness and grief, while others are not.

									Question : Where did the Infallibles get their knowledge from? Was it taught to them by their parents and the Prophet (peace be upon him) or was it all given to them directly from God?

The other kind is the information that they need in their everyday life which they get from Almighty Allah.

									Question : Did the Imams (peace be upon them) claim to be infallible?
								","
									Answer : There is no doubt that the followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) base the belief in the infallibility of the Imams (peace be upon them) on solid sources, starting from verse 33:33. Other texts indicate this directly and sometimes indirectly. As an example, in Ziyarat al-Jami’ah, which was narrated from Imam Ali Al-Hadi (peace be upon him) with an authentic chain: ""Allah has guarded you from lapses and saved you from attractions (of life, Satan, etc).""

Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) knew that he was going to die in Karbala, how is this?
								","
									Answer : The meaning of the verse is that a human being by his nature does not know the time of his death. This does not mean that all people are like that. Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) came to know this from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and the latter was informed of this by revelation and contact with the unseen world.

									Question : How do we seek intercession with God through the Prophet and Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them all)? Is there a certain dua?
								","
									Answer : It was reported in some narrations that Imam Mosa Al-Kadhim â€“ our Seventh Imam (peace be upon him) â€“ said to his one of companions: â€œIf you have a request from Allah say: Allahumma inni Asâ€™aloka bi haqqi Mohammadin wa Alliyyin fa inna lehuma shaanan minash-shaan, wa qadran minal-qader, fa bihaqqi dhalikash-shaan wa bihaqqi thalikal-qader, an tosalli alla Mohammadin wa Aal-Mohammad wa anâ€¦â€¦."" then you mention your request.
The translation of the said supplication is: O my Lord I ask you by the right of Mohammad and Ali as they have a (high) position amongst the positions and a (high) value amongst the values.

The following verse is sufficient to prove it, when Almighty Allah said: “And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful” (4:64).

									Answer : The Sunnis are not the enemies of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) even if they do not follow them or believe in their Imamate. They – in general – love the Ahlulbait. Our Imams (peace be upon them) ordered us to associate with them in kindness and to communicate with them regularly. It was reported in an authentic narration that one of the companions asked Imam Al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), “How should we fare with each other, with our own people and with people who do not espouse our beliefs?” The Imam (peace be upon him) said, ""You should look up to your Imams whom you follow and do as they do. By Allah, they visit their sick, attend their funerals, testify for or against them and return the trust to them."" The enemies of the Ahlulbait are those who hate them and bear animosity with them. They are known by their names and personalities in the books of history and biographies. There were many rulers who acted with hostility against the Imams (peace be upon them) that lead to the Imams being killed, expelled and imprisoned. This can be found by referring to history books.

"2123","
									Question : Many people who are not Sayyids claim that there is no difference between a Sayyid and a non-Sayyid. Is this considered to be an insult to them?
								","
									Answer : If they meant by what they are saying that God-fearing is the criteria in the nobility of the person based on what the Messenger of Allah has said: “There is no difference between an Arab and a non-Arab except by Taqwa (God-fearing),” then that is not an insult or humiliation for the offspring of the Prophet, as the offspring of the Prophet is expected more than other people to act upon the Sharia of their grandfather (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).  If they mean to eliminate the respect for the children of the Prophet in society, then this is not right as there is no doubt that it is a good thing to respect the noble progeny, as it is respect for the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) himself.

If humans were like machines such that their acts are under compulsion, then praising those who do good and dispraising those who commit bad deeds would be meaningless. However, all of this is within the boundaries of Almighty God’s power.

It is one of the best forms of worship, since it includes presenting the request to Almighty Allah and submitting to His lordship, as all things are under His control: “His verily is all creation and commandment"" (7:54). In this seeking of intercession, there is the submitting of the high positions of His close ones who He has chosen and this is one of the signs of faith. There are many proofs establishing the permissibility of such worship.

									Question : The Holy Prophet said that his intercession is for those who committed major sins. He also said that whoever does not believe in his intercession does not deserve it. But according to me, I do not want to expect intercession from anyone in this world, and that is an advantage, because if you do then you will commit sins and you might not repent for that because you think that Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) will intercede for me on the Day of Reckoning. So is it an obligation to believe and expect intercession from the holy Prophet and holy Imams and Fatima Al Zahra (peace be on them) on Day of Judgment?
								","
									Answer : Intercession means to seek from the prophets and divinely appointed holy leaders the mercy of Allah and His forgiveness. It is a Quranic concept confirmed by the teachings of the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them all). However, a righteous devotee is encouraged to avoid sins, and if they occur, to repent to Almighty Allah and return to Him asking forgiveness and mercy. At the same time, he should ask the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) to intercede and ask the Almighty Allah to grant him His mercy and acceptance. There is no doubt that joining between repentance and the intercession is more secure to obtain salvation rather than relying on repentance alone.Having said that, this does not mean that one should rely on intercession and commit sins as this leads to disregarding sins, which is one of the greatest sins that may disqualify the person from deserving intercession. Committing sins while belittling them leads to disregarding Allah's punishment and it is amongst the greatest sins. This might lead to losing the good end of this life and not dying as a believer, which is - no doubt - one of the conditions of deserving intercession. There is a difference between the desire of getting the intercession and the hope that one gets it, on one hand, and depending on intercession and committing sins because of this dependence on the other hand. The former places the person far from committing sins, whereas the latter encourages the person to commit sins and may lose, at the end, the chance to get the intercession.

									Question : How can we prove Imamate from the Quran? If Imamate is such a backbone for Shia Islam and we believe that if one does not accept the Wilayah of Imam Ali (peace be upon him), he is at loss, then why did not Allah mention this directly in the Holy Quran, thus avoiding major disputes? How do we answer the objection that there is no proof about the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) being essential?
								","
									Answer : This question presents important issues that require an explanation, since this is one of the most important fallacies that the enemies of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) present. We would like to draw your attention to a few important issues in order to clarify the truth:Firstly: Doubting the Imamate of the Ahlulbait just because it is not mentioned in the Holy Book is in reality doubting the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) and belittling his position in being an essential source of religious laws and a speaker of the truth, which in turn raises a big question on the credibility of Islam as a religion and the Holy book as a divine text that “falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it,” as the Quran states clearly. But rather, the Quran itself presents the Messenger of Allah and his conduct as the truth that is not associated with any falsehood, misguidance and forgetfulness. This is explicitly mentioned in the Holy Quran, when the Almighty stated, “Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired,” (Quran 53:3-4) and “whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids, abstain (from it),” (Quran 7:59) and also, “But nay, by thy Lord, they will not have (true) faith until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decides, and submit with full submission.”(Quran 65:4) Based on this, a Muslim should research about Imamate as well as the position of the Sunnah in its regards, just as he looks for the position of the Sunnah with respect to the religious obligations like the prayers, the fast, pilgrimage and the like, as these essential obligations are not mentioned in the Holy Book with detail, but the Sunnah explained the ways to perform them. It is sufficient to prove the Imamate by referring to the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis, like the book of al-Bukhari and the book of Muslim and all the authenticated books in which they included narrations of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) that refer in a clear way to the leadership of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) after the Prophet, like when he said: “Whosoever’s master I am, Ali is his master.” Also: “Ali is your wali (leader) after me.” And also, when he said to Ali (peace be upon him): “You are to me like Aaron was to Moses, but there is no prophet after me,” and the like in innumerable narrations. There are other narrations that relate to the religious authority of the Ahlubait (peace be upon them) in general, like: “I am leaving among you two weighty things: the Book of Allah and my household; as long as you are attached to them both, you shall never be misguided.”Secondly: there are verses of the Holy Quran which, as the narrations indicate, were revealed in respect of Imam Ali (peace be upon him). They are narrated by Sunni Muslims. They also indicate in a clear way the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon them) like when Almighty Allah said, “Your guardian can be only Allah, and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the alms, while they bow down (in prayer).” (Quran 55:5) And even the verse, “Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you with authority.” (Quran 59:4) They indicate in a clear way that those in authority whose obedience is necessary are infallible since – based on the verse – one should obey them as one obeys Almighty Allah and likewise the Messenger of Allah, and nobody fulfills this condition except the Imams of the Ahlulbait, whom Almighty Allah purified with a thorough purification as per the verse 33:33. Furthermore, Muslims have unanimously agreed on the righteousness of the Imams of the Ahlulbait, their highness, the strength in their faith, their knowledge in the affairs of religion, as this clearly appears to the individual who looks at their history and biography. Could any Muslim accept that Almighty Allah would order Muslims to obey those in authority by applying this title on anyone that assumes power, whether he does this by force or through inheritance, even if he committed the most heinous of crimes like Yazid bin Mu’awiyah and similar despots? Are the aforementioned verses not sufficient in proving the Imamate of the Ahlulbait from the Quran for the fair-minded searcher for the truth?Thirdly: What you have mentioned – that if the Holy Quran had named Imam Ali (peace be upon him) clearly as the successor to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) there would be no conflict between Muslims – is not correct. There are a number of verses that clearly describe certain rulings, and, despite that, Muslims did not agree on them; an example of such a case is the verse of ablution in which the way of performing ablution has been clearly explained, and there is no doubt that the verse is clear in its meaning when it was revealed, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) used to perform wudhu repeatedly in the presence of Muslims. Despite all this, there was a difference in opinion in understanding it. Another example is the verses of divorce which indicate that the three consecutive divorces pronounced in one place and time is not considered as three divorces – by which a man cannot return to the wife – but some Muslim jurists regard this type of divorce as valid and a man cannot return to his wife thereafter. There are many other such examples in jurisprudential issues, although all Muslims base their conclusions on the Holy Book. Furthermore, if one looks in the biography of the Prophet, he could clearly conclude that some of his companions were not obeying him or even respecting him properly. They used to dare to disobey him and not care about his orders; it is sufficient to mention some incidents from the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis: (1) Most of the Muslims fled from a number of battles that were led by the Messenger of Allah, like Uhud, Hunayn and Khaybar, whereas the Holy Book states clearly the prohibition to do so and that whoever does so will be punished in Hell for eternity. Almighty Allah said: “Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.”(Quran 16:8) (2) What took place during the “tragedy of Thursday”: Abdullah bin Abbas – as it is narrated in the Sunni books of narrations like the Musnad of Ahmad – said, weeping, “The day of Thursday! And what day was Thursday!! The Messenger of Allah said to us: “Bring to me a broad bone [to be used to write on] and ink, so I may write for you something that you shall not be misguided after it is written.” Umar said: “The Messenger of Allah is incoherent.” In some of the narrations, they were arguing; some of them were in favor of Umar and some others were saying, “Bring for the Messenger of Allah what he asked for.” The Messenger of Allah said then: “Leave me!! There should not be a fight in my presence.” From the said incident one can conclude that the refusal of the Prophet to write what he wanted to write was to preserve the dignity of Prophethood, since it is not appropriate for the Prophet to order for something in a clear and direct way and Muslim differ in their opinions whether to obey him or not, since there should be no dispute after the order has been issued. From this, one can conclude the reason why the name of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was not mentioned in the Holy Book; Almighty Allah knew that there were some people who wanted to rule and were ready to disobey Allah and His Messenger in an open way, and they had their supporters who were willing to help and encourage them. If the Holy Quran was to mention Imam Ali’s name, then they would doubt the Holy Book in the same way as they have doubted the Messenger of Allah. This would result in the rejection or alteration of the Holy Book.

									Question : Why did Almighty Allah appoint Imams?
								","
									Answer : Almighty Allah appointed the Imams to guard the religion and protect it from misguidance and to continue the message of Islam that started with the prophethood of Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him and his household) for mankind. People did not obey Allah’s orders in this matter due to their desire to possess authority and to be in control. This led to tragedies amongst Muslims for centuries until they separated into different sects and were controlled by the infidels. Almighty Allah said: “And if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil, surely we should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth. But (unto every messenger) they gave the lie, and so we seized them on account of what they used to earn.” (7:96)

									Question : What is the relevance of the concept of Wilayat (authority) of the Imams in our lives today?
								","
									Answer : We can comment on your question by stating the following: 1. The Imamate of the Imams (peace be upon them) has been legislated by Almighty Allah for people to observe. Every Muslim must obey all that has been proven to be divinely legislated obligations without considering the immediate benefit of the law on his everyday life since believing in a religion is believing in all what is proven to be part of it. 2. Believing in the Wilayat of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is following them and observing their teachings. This has a great effect on the way a believer deals with day-to-day matters based on the teachings and the guidelines that originate from them. We can see that amongst the characteristics of the followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) by which they are known today is their condemnation of terrorism and tyranny against innocents, especially children, women and old people, and this is not but a reflection of their attachment with the humane teachings of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them).

									Question : As we know, Imamate is a divine position that cannot be taken away by anybody.

What exactly was taken away from him, because the true believers were still following him?
								","
									Answer : What you said is true. Imamate is a divine position that cannot be taken by anyone. The application of this right is represented by the management of the affairs of people with justice according to the divine rules of Almighty Allah, and since Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was not able to exercise this right of authority for some time, we can say that the ruling and management of the affairs of people based on correct religious standards was taken from him.

There is no doubt in the narrations of the Ahlulbait that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) is better than all mankind and the superiority of the Ahlulbait over mankind is based on their relation to him and being the closest ever to him in their action and faith. It is enough to refer to this narration that Al-Kulayni reported to clear this fallacy: “A man asked Imam Ali (peace be upon him): Since when has your Lord existed? Imam replied: ""When was He ever absent so one could ask: since when did He exist?"". The man then asked the Imam: “O Commander of the Believers, are you a prophet?” Imam replied by saying: ""Woe to you, I am only one of Mohammad’s slaves.""

The books of beliefs state these proofs clearly. Many narrations from Sunni and Shia books of traditions mention that the Imams are twelve, without mentioning their names.

									Question : What is the philosophy of Infallibility? Is it true that the Shia believe that the Prophet and the Imams (peace be upon them) cannot make mistakes?

									Answer : There is no dispute amongst the followers of the Ahlul-bait (peace be upon them) that the Prophets and the Imams are sinless, in such a way that they do not commit what opposes the religion. Our scholars have explained in their books of beliefs the evidences to prove this concept. There is no doubt that the Prophet and the Imam are appointed by Almighty Allah. He has ordered people to follow them. So, if it is possible for them to commit sins, they might order people to do so as well and people have to follow them. So their orders would not be trusted to be from Almighty Allah, and He will not order us to follow somebody who can misguide us. Similarly, they are to be taken by their followers as role models. If they were to commit sins, others will be encouraged to do the same.

									Question : I want to know what is the authenticity status of the advice of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) mentioned in Letter 31 in Nahjul Balagha? Some say that it is partially or completely unauthentic. What are your views regarding this?
								","
									Answer : The said letter is not different from the rest of the letters found in Nahjul Balagha. The doubt about the authenticity of the letter may come from the fact that this letter includes advises directed to Imam Hassan (peace be upon him) which raises the question about the need of the young Imam to such directions although he is infallible. Apparently, the said doubt is not valid since this way of presenting advice could be for the sake of reminding the person and repeatedly giving him the advice. The Quran used this way when Almighty Allah said: “And warn, for warning profits believers.” (51:55) Also, it could be indirect guidance to all Muslims by directing the advice to Imam Hassan (peace be upon him). This way is also mentioned in the Holy book as well. Almighty Allah said: “And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no Allah save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back.” (28:88) In this verse God is addressing the Prophet with guidance, while it is abundantly clear that the Prophet would not worship anyone but Almighty Allah.

									Question : Some people are calling Imam Ali (peace be upon him) as their creator and sustainer. What do you think about this?

									Answer : This belief is invalid, and it is not of the Shia scholars. Shia religious scholars have agreed that the Imams (peace be upon them) are created slaves of Almighty Allah. He created them like He created everybody else. The religious narrations of the Imams themselves confirm this truth. Yes, there is no doubt that the Imams showed miracles, like the prophets (peace be upon them). Almighty Allah said with respect to Jesus (peace be upon him): “I come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah’s leave. I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah’s leave.

								","
									Answer : There is nothing wrong with seeking the mercy directly from Almighty Allah, nor with seeking the intercession of Imam Ali (peace be upon him), since the matter entirely is in hand of Allah.

									Answer : We are not aware of a historical source that clearly indicates this, but offering the prayer behind Abu Bakr does not give legitimacy to his caliphate. Imam (peace be upon him) no doubt was forced to give the allegiance to Abu Bakr. He did so because those people were ready to kill whoever does not pay allegiance. They killed Sa’d bin Abadah because he did not agree with them although he left Medina and migrated to Syria and did not resist them. This clearly shows that they were willing to do anything in order to be in power. From this, one can conclude that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was coerced into certain positions. It is not far to consider that such prayers – if it really happened – made them confident that the Imam (peace be upon him) was not acting against them.

Mohammed bin Handhala asked Imam Jafar Al-Sadiq (peace be upon him) that some of the Shia companions stated that the best time for the believer to see the benefit of his belief in the Imamate of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is when he is about to die.

A person who has been raised in remote and distant places cannot learn about Islam and its teachings, so how can he go to Hell? This will be against the justice of Allah Almighty.
								","
									Answer : There is no doubt that Almighty Allah, after He sent the Messenger and required people to believe him and act upon the ruling of the religion, has established the evidences to prove the truth of the message, so He will reward those who obey and accept the call, and He will judge those who did not accept and did not have an excuse. As for those who had valid excuses for their non-acceptance, like the lack of available evidences or because of lack of sanity, Almighty Allah will judge them accordingly, since He “wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant” (4:40). However, we cannot determine those who are excused and those who are not, and one should undertake his personal search for the right religion. Allah Almighty knows the circumstances and the intentions of His slaves. We, as humans, are only aware of the apparent behavior of people. The verse that you were referring to, that talks about the believers in previous religions, is interpreted in many religious texts to be referring to the believers of those religions before the emergence of Islam. This interpretation of the verse is consistent with the teachings of the rest of the Quran, like when Almighty Allah said: “And whoso seeks as religion other than Islam it will not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter” (3:85).

Taqiyya was established in the Holy Book when Almighty Allah said: “Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless (it be) that ye but guard yourselves against them, taking (as it were) security. Allah biddeth you beware (only) of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying” (3-21).He also said: “Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief – save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom” (16-6). This last verse was revealed when Ammar bin Yasir was coerced to let the idolaters hear what they wanted to hear, words of disbelief, in order to avoid being tortured further. When he stated this to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), he approved what Ammar did. The Prophet even told Ammar that if the idolaters return to you, let them hear again what you told them. This incident is mentioned in various books of history and Quranic commentaries. The Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) were subject to difficult situations, and they were forced to apparently recognize the rulers of their times, even though the Imams knew of the oppression and tyranny of such rulers.

They have related this belief to the verse: “When they [hypocrites] meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe.’ But when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: ‘We are really with you, we (were) only jesting.’” (Quran, 2:14) I am having a hard time replying to this.

									Answer : The connection made between reconciliatory Taqiyya – which is based on softening the hearts – and the mentioned verse is originated from intolerance against the Shias and ignorance of the reasons and justifications behind Taqiyyah. All Muslims are under the flag of Islam and softening their heart by the decrease of their differences is amongst the interests that has concerned the Shias and their Imams throughout history. The mentioned verse speaks of the hypocrites who do not believe in the Hereafter or in the foundations of the religion, and they claim to be Muslims in front of other Muslims. So how are those people considered to be attempting to unite the Muslims and decrease the level of differences between them? Those fanatics do not understand anything but intolerance and rejection of other sects and disregarding them, and do not care about the image of Islam or its high concerns. Today they are more harmful than the direct enemies of Islam as a result of their behaviors that originated from narrow-minded thinking and blind prejudice.

									Question : Why do we pray on stones (turbah) and Sunnis do not? How can it be possible that they do not even have one document or narration on this issue? How is that when Muslims at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) prayed in congregation and did not know that praying on sand/stone is obligatory?
								","
									Answer : It was narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) has said: “Indeed, Earth is made for me (by Almighty Allah) a place of prostration and a mean of purification (in Tayammum).” This narration and the like clearly indicates that it is obligatory to prostrate on natural earth like soil, stones and the like, instead of carpets and rugs. Sunnis do not act upon these narrations because of misinterpretation or they do not rely on them.

									Question : Why is the dog najis in Islam?
								","
									Answer : Islam is a divine religion that Almighty Allah revealed to guard the welfare of people. Almighty Allah knows the reality of things and what benefits His slaves, so He set laws accordingly for them to observe. Since Islam is the seal of religions, these laws are for until the end of this world. Because of corruption, badness and evilness in certain things or acts, He commanded us to refrain from them and made them prohibited. Similarly, because of benefits and goodness in certain other things, He ordered us to perform them and made them obligatory on us. Some of these laws are general and apply to all people, all the time, and anywhere.The ability of the human being is limited, so is unable to find out and understand the reasons behind the Sharia of Almighty Allah. Sometimes Allah Almighty has taught us through the Holy Prophet and the Imams (peace be upon them), the wisdom behind certain few rulings. We must obey His laws by refraining from the prohibited acts and undertaking the obligatory acts, even if we do not know the reason behind each and every one of them.The najasah of the dog is one of the rulings about which we do not know the wisdom behind.

									Question : What is concept of Bad<U+0101>' (alteration in the divine will)? Why do people dispute over the Imamah of Imam Musa al-Kadhim (peace be upon him)?
								","
									Answer : There is no doubt that Bad<U+0101>' exists. Verses from the Holy Book prove it, such as: “Allah effaces what He wills, and establishes (what He wills), and with Him is the source of ordinance.” (39:13) Aside from this, there are numerous narrations, which explain that Almighty Allah’s knowledge does not change by the sequence of events. Some incidents might lead, as they happen based on their natural sequence, to a different result and its real destiny that Almighty Allah knows may not correspond to what one might imagine from preceding incidents. Bada' can take place for any incident, including the issue of the passing of Imamate. Almighty Allah limited this position to certain personalities. However, people could conclude from certain circumstances that a different person will fill this position. Because of his piety, Isma'il, the oldest son of Imam Jafar Al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), was seen by Shias to be the next Imam after his father’s death, and for some of them it may have been something very obvious. But Almighty Allah knew that this will not happen, and thus Isma'il died during his father’s lifetime, and the next Imam was Isma'il's brother, Musa al-Kadhim (peace be upon him).

So you should search for what the shia give as a proof to the obligation to follow the Ahlulbyte after the death of the prophet and do not look for the details at the present stage. If their argument were proven to you then you can look for explanations to their practices if you were convinced with them, you can practice them as well otherwise you can refuse to practice them. If you were to start searching for the explanations to the details of the practices then this might confuse you more.
2.	The thing that the imams of the Ahlulbyte emphasized on is the mourning and expressing pain and passion because of the oppression that the Ahlulbyte undertook, the disasters and the pains that they faced. The course of practice that devotee chose to express the mentioned obligation is entirely personal. Some express their feelings towards Imam Hussein (Peace be upon him) and his companions and his household by crying, expressing their sadness and wearing black clothes. Others do so by slapping their chests. Some others use bleeding as a way to express they sympathy with the imam and his household and companions as they were killed and stabbed with spears, swards and arrows."

								","
									Answer : The mentioned narrations are rejected by Shias and Sunnis, which suggests the lack of credibility in these traditions. Muslims were paying attention since the very early days of Islam in memorizing the Holy Book, reciting it, teaching it and spreading it. It was reported that the month of Ramadan is the spring season of the Holy Book, referring to the best time of the year. It was a common practice to recite the entire Quran during this month. Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (peace be upon him) recited the Holy Book ten times during the holy month. It was also narrated that Imam Ali Al-Ridha (peace be upon him) did the same. Since the earliest days of Islam, there were certain reciters who specialized in the recitation of the Quran and they taught it to others. As such, the Book was widespread amongst the Muslims in general, not to any special class in the Muslim society, and they went to great lengths to preserve the words of the Quran without any changes and alterations. All of this indicates that the Holy Quran which we currently have, reached us from generation after generation. Therefore, the claim that you refer to in your question is meaningless and rejected.

The current books of Quran that are spread in all Muslim countries serve as evidence to this truth. Muslims consider reciting the entirety of the current copies of the Quran to be the complete reciting of the Book of Allah. Similarly, a recitation of a Surah in the current Quran is considered to be the recitation of the complete Surah. They do not add a word or remove another. The said is clear in their understanding, conduct and in the verdicts of their religious scholars. This practical consensus is one of the strongest proofs of the Muslims’ position in general – whether they are Shia or Sunni – on the Holy Quran. Nothing can stand against such evidence as it expresses the fact that the noble Quran is entirely extant in the current book as an existing and self-evident truth. Muslims have acknowledged it and implemented it, while all fallacies seeking to cause doubt in it have failed.”

									Answer : Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him) does not have an eternal life; rather, he is promised to live a long life. He will appear to people when the circumstances are right to establish justice on Earth. After that, the divine law of death will include him. Almighty Allah said:” Lo! You will die, and lo! They will die;” This long life is not common amongst most people, although it is proven to be for some of them, like prophet Noah (peace be upon him), who lived as a prophet before the flood for 950 years. In some narrations, Khidhr is also alive and he is older than Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him). There is no cause for doubt about the Imam’s existence because of his long life, since the authenticated texts prove his presence and his Imamate.

									Question : I am interested to know what the Muslim faith thinks of the Catholic faith in particular Jesus, Mary, the mother of god and the holy bible. As your faith is widely misconceived
								","
									Answer : Thank you for your communication with us about important and sensitive subjects that relates to the main catholic beliefs. We admire your way in approaching us to learn about the truth from a reliable Islamic source. We advise you to recite the Quran, and refer to it to learn about Muslim beliefs as it is their holy book and they believe in it with total conviction.
Muslimsâ€™ belief in the divine existence of God is based on proofs and evidences mentioned in a clear way in the Holy Book. They believe that God is one, and He is all surrounding things. He holds all the attributes of goodness. The last two verses from the 59th chapter refer to this when Almighty Allah said: â€œHe is Allah, other than Whom there is no other Allah, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. () He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wiseâ€<U+009D>.
When man explores the greatness of this universe â€“ by learning and searching using the modern means, in such a way that is very amazing way, it becomes very clear that Almighty Allahâ€™s greatness, capability and encompassing are in an absolute measure and beyond imagination when He created this huge universe with this perfection from nothingness. This, by itself, is sufficient to prove the greatness of the Lord and His absolute capability and wisdom.
Jesus is mentioned in the holy Quran numerous times with respect and appreciation, as he is one of the righteous slaves of God whom He sent unto mankind to guide them to believe in monotheism and to obey His orders and to propagate them. Verses 45-51 from the 3rd chapter refers to this truth when Almighty God said: â€<U+009D>(And remember) when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah gives thee glad tidings of a Word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (unto Allah).() He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of the righteous. () She said: My Lord! How can I have a child when no man hath touched me? He said: So (it will be). Allah creates what He wills. If He decrees a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.() And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel, () And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying): Lo! I come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers. ()And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. () Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.â€<U+009D>
Mary was a righteous woman; Almighty Allah took special care of her when He made one of His great prophets, Zachariah, as her guardian. She was mentioned in the holy Quran numerously like when Almighty Allah said in verses 35-37 from the 3rd chapter : â€<U+009D>(Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my womb as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! () And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast. () And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said: O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)? She answered: It is from Allah. Allah gives without measure to whom He will.â€<U+009D>
The Holy Quran mentioned the birth of Jesus, the son of Mary, and how it was by Godâ€™s order and not in a usual way of creating the human being, as Mary gave birth to Jesus without marriage as a virgin. She was facing the accusations of the society and mischief makers of committing the sin; but the Almighty Lord proved her innocence when her noble son Jesus spoke in his first hours. This was one of Godâ€™s miracles and implementation of Godâ€™s will in a direct way by giving birth to this blessed child. Verses 16-35 from chapter 19, Chapter of Mary, explain this incident when Almighty Allah said:â€<U+009D> And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, () And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man () She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing. () He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son () She said: How can I have a son when no man hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? () He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. () And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. () And the pains of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! () Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, () And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee () So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and I will not speak this day to any man. () Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with a string thing. () O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. () Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? () He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, () And hath made me blessed whosesoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, () And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. () Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! () Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. () It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. ()â€<U+009D>
The Bible is amongst the godly revealed books which are mentioned in the holy Quran in many verses. Its aim was to clarify the religious truths and the divine religion of Allah which Jesus brought from Almighty Allah. Verse 46 from chapter 5 refers to this in a clear way when Almighty Lord said: â€œAnd We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).â€<U+009D>
Finally we ask the Lord, the Beneficent to guide us all to His right path."

He suffered much pain and harm in order to deliver the message of Islam to the nation. He directed his nation to the right direction after his death when he ordered them to guard the teachings of the Quran and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). He guaranteed that if both were adhered to, they will never be misguided. Part of the nation of Islam abandoned the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) and the differences between the nation of Islam became a reality. We, as followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) should act upon their teachings and uphold their directions to the right path, while dealing with the rest of the Muslims with good manners and etiquettes, and not raise the differences or cause hatred against them, since we all believe in Almighty Allah and His Messenger and the common religious obligations, like prayers, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, etc., in order to preserve the general entity of Islam.

									Question : What is Irfan? And could you please give your opinion about it?
								","
									Answer : ‘Irfan’ is a word derived from ‘Ma’rifah’, which is the personal cognizance and understanding that affects the self. It has become a term for certain ideas related to the universe and existence in general, and to God, His attributes and His names. On the other hand, ‘irfan’ has the objective of the purification of one's self, and may entail claims of discoveries and observations beyond the usual capabilities and perceptions of humans. Some might consider this knowledge to be similar to divine revelation, so it may cause one to fall into dangers, as one may then not be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Indeed, because of this, many have fallen into clear violations of the Sharia. This has been one of the reasons of misguidance, until it reached the level that religious obligations were dropped and the mention of God in the heart was considered to be sufficient without the need to perform the religious obligations. Hence, it is necessary for the believers to beware of getting into this field without discernment. Instead, they should adhere to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah, which emphasize acting upon the Sharia duties which are related to the relationship with God, like prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, zakat, etc., as well as those obligations related to social duties, such as being dutiful to parents, having good relationships with relatives, having good communication and empathy with other believers, giving sufficient attention to family members, with due regard to their rights and raising them in a proper way, and other obligations that are explained in books of religious jurisprudence. The Islamic sources have emphasized the performance of religious acts in a particular prescribed way, so the believer can fulfil his religious responsibilities. They also recommend various voluntary acts of worship to allow us to get closer to God and to lead to our good deeds gaining divine acceptance. The Islamic sources have also emphasized non-reliance on this world and to not be overly concerned about it, and they have explained that the world is a temporary abode and we are on a short journey through it. They say that one should equip himself in this finite world with good deeds and high morals, and only this can be an asset to take to the next world and ensure one’s eternal happiness, amongst the righteous followers and the Prophets and Imams (peace be upon them). The Islamic sources have also given emphasis on the importance of exhortation and remembrance of the Hereafter, and reflection on the demise of the world and its manifestations. One should not become negligent or forgetful of this. Thus, the values and ideals are enriched in himself and his soul will no longer pay attention to the world and its delusions that lead to sins and wrongdoings. Believers are advised to give due attention to the recitation of the Quran and the supplications narrated from the Prophet and his household (peace be upon them all), as well as their advice and teachings. All of these have a great impact in raising the soul and purifying it from vices; and before all of this, believers are urged to rely on Almighty Allah and seek His mercy and grace, which will lead to their guidance and protection from sins and evil. Almighty Allah said: “And whosoever places his trust in Allah, He will suffice him.” He also said: “As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and surely Allah is with the good-doers.""

"2511","
									Question : Are the rules of Sharia only valid for Muslims? Is it allowed for an Islamic country to enforce Non-Muslim women to wear hijab, for example?
								","
									Answer : Almighty Allah made the religious laws of worship, like praying and fasting, and other laws like the obligation of wearing hijab and the prohibition of consuming wine, general to all mankind. The Muslim that does not obey the Almighty Allah in observing one or more of those laws will be punished for this disobedience. Non-Muslims will be punished because of their refusal to believe in Almighty Allah and His Messenger (Peace be upon him. If the non-Muslim can present an acceptable justification for his refusal to believe, then this justification will also apply even more so for his disobedience of Allah Almighty. If he cannot present a justification before Almighty Allah for his refusal to believe, he would have a lesser chance to do so for not observing the Sharia laws.

They say that one should equip himself in this finite world with good deeds and high morals, and only this can be an asset to take to the next world and ensure one’s eternal happiness, amongst the righteous followers and the Prophets and Imams (peace be upon them). The Islamic sources have also given emphasis on the importance of exhortation and remembrance of the Hereafter, and reflection on the demise of the world and its manifestations. One should not become negligent or forgetful of this. Thus, the values and ideals are enriched in himself and his soul will no longer pay attention to the world and its delusions that lead to sins and wrongdoings. Believers are advised to give due attention to the recitation of the Quran and the supplications narrated from the Prophet and his household (peace be upon them all), as well as their advice and teachings. All of these have a great impact in raising the soul and purifying it from vices; and before all of this, believers are urged to rely on Almighty Allah and seek His mercy and grace, which will lead to their guidance and protection from sins and evil. Almighty Allah said: “And whosoever places his trust in Allah, He will suffice him.” He also said: “As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and surely Allah is with the good-doers.""

									Question : What is your opinion on Tatbeer knowing that it has been used by the non-Muslims as a way of attacking and insulting the Muslims?
								","
									Answer : The abuse and slander against Shias will not stop even if they stopped performing Tatbeer, as it was continuing for centuries against them because of their commemoration of the tragedy of Ashura. The reason behind this is obvious: because it places the role of the Muslim caliphate into question since the authorities killed the grandson of the Prophet, Imam Hussien (peace be upon him), in such a terrible way only fifty years after the death of the founder of the religion, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).The act of Tatbeer is not a general practice of the Shias on the day of Ashura since those who perform it is limited in number with respect to the population of Shias that commemorate the tragedy every year. From that, one can conclude that the slander against the Shia is simply due to them performing Tatbeer.

									Question : Many shia brethren (on Islamic forums) have started to judge between narrations whether they are authentic or non authentic in shia books by naming them as Sahih, Hasan, Daef, Mursal. For e.g. if a narrator of a well known narrations is Majhul unknown, they use this as a proof to say that the narration is inauthentic. Can you please clarify if this is how our Esteemed Scholars and Jurists authenticate a narration?

									Answer : No one has the right to consider a narration as non authentic or reject it without proper evidence. There are differences in the ways of authentication between experts in this field themselves. Non experts does not have the right to pass a judgment in this issue, otherwise the person who do so will be questioned before almighty Allah in the Day of Judgment.
If the narration was non authentic or does not have the conditions of being accepted, we donâ€™t have the right to reject it or consider it as false. However, we should return the verdict in this issue to the Imams of the Ahlulbait since almighty Allah knows the truth. There are many narrations that emphasize this meaning. Imam Mohamed Albaqir said: â€œThe most liked amongst my companions are those who know their religious Jurisprudence more and those who fear god more and the most that I dislike is the one that when they hear a narration that they were told that it is related to us or narrated from us but their hearts do not tolerate it so then they reject it.

To this effect, the Ziyara of Jameâ€™a includes the passage: â€œAllah created you as lights around His throne until he blessed us with youâ€¦â€<U+009D>.

									Question : The messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) is Ummi as per the holy Quran/in chapter 62 Juma. Ummi means jaahil (illiterate) but only Shia call the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as not jaahil (illiterate)?
								","
									Answer : Illiteracy is the lack of knowledge and understanding. It is a sort of imperfection that cannot be part of the prophet's personality. The messenger of Allah was - without any doubt - aware of all what he needed to prove and support his message. The huge amount of information and knowledge that were spread in many narrations is sufficient to prove such a truth. Imam Ali was referring to such enormous knowledge when he said: ""the messenger of Allah taught me a thousand doors (kind) of knowledge; each one of them opens to a thousand more doors"".
Not being able to read is not a deficiency since reading is a way people use to gain information and knowledge  and the prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) did not gain his knowledge throughout studying and learning but rather got them directly from Almighty Allah."

									Question : We are told that Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him and his noble progeny) went on Meâ€™raj to have a conversation with God. What was the Meâ€™raj and where did he travel to, if it really happened?","

Also, he mentioned certain metaphysical incidents that took place which indicate his ascendance to a metaphysical world that Almighty Allah wanted to show his prophet the big and great signs in this journey.
We, as believers in the Prophet, believe in what he informed us in regards to this ascendance, just as we believe in all what he informed us regarding the metaphysical worlds, like Heaven, Hell, the Day of Judgments, the Bridge, etc., after his prophecy and truthfulness has been proven.

Should Shias call her Umm Al Mumineen?
								","
									Answer : Holy Quran called the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and holy progeny) as the mothers of believers. There is no doubt that this name applies to them, but there is no obligation to mention it every time the name of a wife is mentioned and this does not mean that they are excluded from committing sins. Everyone Allah Almighty creates is subject to the general divine rule that everyone bears the responsibilities of their actions, as Almighty Allah said: ""And whoso doeth good an atoms weight will see it then, And whoso doeth ill an atoms weight will see it then.""

									Question : Why did the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) marry Aisha? Was there any specific purpose behind it? I am asking this question because the non-Muslims get a chance of making accusations against the Prophet.
								","
									Answer : The Prophetâ€™s (peace be upon him and his progeny) marriage to Aisha is looked at by the enemies of Islam as a negative episode in the Prophetâ€™s life, using the current cultural view about the age of the wife. This cultural view about the success of the marriage and personal life of the wife when she marries at a later age is a result of our modern time and its complications, and did not exist during that time nor did it exist during later eras.
Anyhow, a researcher will see that history did not reflect that she was forced into the marriage. All this shows that what the enemies of Islam present as a negative side in the personality of the Prophet is not based on a realistic foundation. It is, rather, using an old incident that took place during totally different social circumstances and judging it based on a modern view of marriage."

And it is better to explain to Sunnis - without inciting them and any bigotry - the necessity to follow the Imams of the Ahlulbait as religious leaders after the Prophet (peace be upon him as his progeny) as the Messenger of Allah himself ordered us to do so when he said: ""I am leaving amongst you the two weighty things, the book of Allah and my household"". We encourage you to do all this with calmness and ease. Almighty Allah said: ""Call unto the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation"".
