Is it permissible to eat foods prepared by Christians and Jews?","Since the followers of the past revealed religions (that is, the Jews, the Christians and the Zoroastrians) are ritually pure, many of the problems concerning the status and permissibility of the food are resolved when we live with them. It becomes permissible for us as Muslims to eat from their food no matter whether they touched it with their wet hands or not, as long as we do not know or are not sure that it consists of what is forbidden to us, like Haram meat.","Sistani"
"2",2,"

Is it permissible to eat food prepared from non-Ahlul Kitãb (i.e. Those who are neither Christians, Jews, nor Zoroastrians) people?","A Muslim is allowed to eat the food prepared by someone who is not from Ahlul Kitãb [for example, a Hindu or a Buddhist], provided that he does not know or is not sure that the non-Ahlulkitab touched the food with wetness; and provided that he does not know or is not sure that the food consists of what is forbidden to him like for example, Haram meat, fat and their extracts. ","Sistani"
"3",3,"

What is the fatwa about Ahlul Kitab? Are they ritually pure (Tahir)?","The Ahlul Kitab (that is, the Christians, the Jews and the Zoroastrians) are ritually pure (Tahir) as long as you do not know that they have become ritually impure (najis) by coming into contact with an impure object.","Sistani"
"4",4,"

Can I eat Christians' foods that contain meat?","All kinds of food with the exception of meat, fat, and their extracts are permissible for a Muslim, even if he doubts that it might contain something which is forbidden for him.","Sistani"

In certain cases doctors advise that the foetus is so deformed that it could be very difficult to treat the born baby and, perhaps, it (the child) would live a very short time suffering pain and agony with his parents, then dies. Is it permissible for the would be mother to abort the foetus? Also, is there any difference between the foetus with a spirit and that which the spirit has not yet entered into yet? Assuming it is permissible, should compensation [or blood money] be payable? Who should pay it?","Abortion in this case is not permissible, even though the soul has not entered the foetus, [let alone a foetus with a soul] .","Sistani"
"6",6,"

Is a mother allowed to abort the feotus, if she does not want it while the soul has not yet entered it and there is no serious danger to the mother’s life?","She is not allowed to do that, except if the continuation of the pregnancy would considerably harm her health or put her in an unbearable difficulty, then it is permissible before the soul enters the feoutus (i.e. the fourth month).","Sistani"
"7",7,"

Sometimes the doctors reach the following conclusion: This foetus is afflicted with a very serious disease; it is therefore preferable that it should be aborted because if that child is born, it will be deformed or will die soon after birth. Is it, therefore, permissible for the doctor to abort the foetus? Is it permissible for the mother to agree to the abortion? And who of the two will become liable for indemnity?","Just the fact that the child will be deformed or that it will not live for a long time after his birth does not ever justify the termination of the pregnancy. Therefore, it is not permissible for the mother to consent to the abortion just as it is not permissible for the doctor to go ahead with the procedure. And whoever performs the abortion will become liable for the payment of indemnity.","Sistani"
"8",8,"

What is your ruling on aborting an “unwanted pregnancy” before  months into the pregnancy?","It is not permissible .","Sistani"
"9",9,"

What is the kaffara of abortion?","In case the mother aborts the child, she must give the indemnity (blood money) to the father or other heirs. And if the father carries out the abortion, the indemnity is obligatory on him and he must give it to the mother.  If it is the doctor who carries out the abortion, it is obligatory on him to give the blood money to the mother and father, even if he may abort the fetus on the parents’ request. He must give the blood money except if the heirs (i.e. the mother and father)exempt him. 
It would suffice for the blood money of the fetus into which soul has entered to give 5250 mithqals of silver. That is when the fetus is male and if it is female, half of that amount should be paid. 
If the fetus is lifeless and it is in the form of a fertilized ovum (zygote), 105 mithqals of silver would suffice for the blood money. In case it is in the form of a leech-like substance, the indemnity is 210 mithqals. If it develops into a chewed-like substance, the indemnity is 315 mithqals. If the fetus has bones, 420 mithqals of silver would suffice. If it has developed into a complete human body with grown up limbs and organs, the indemnity is 525 mithqals of silver. If the fetus is soulless, there is no difference between a male fetus and a female one as an obligatory precaution. The Soul enters the body at the fourth month of pregnancy except for when it is proved otherwise through modern technology. 
If the fetus is alive and it is aborted, the indemnity is 5250 mithqal of silver for a male child and 2625 mithqal for a female child. 
*Every mithqal of silver is equivalent to 4.64 g of Silver.*","Sistani"

I have a medical illness, and have become pregnant recently, under what circumstances is an abortion allowed?","Abortion is not allowed after the implantation of the [fertilized] ovum [on the lining of the womb], except if the mother’s life is in danger,  and in this case, it would be permissible to abort the foetus as long as the soul has not entered into it (i.e. before the end of 4 months); after the entering of the soul, it is not permissible, as an obligatory precaution.","Sistani"
"11",11,"

Are we allowed to adopt children and consider them as our own children?","It is permissible for a person to adopt a child and taking care of a deserving child on its own earns is a rewarding deed, but the child legally (Islamic Shariah) is not considered his son or daughter; i.e. the child remains non-mahram to him or his wife and he or she does not inherit from the ones who has adopted him or her. 
Adoption in the sense to change a child's surname and register him in the official documents as the parents own child is not permissible.","Sistani"
"13",13,"

What is the stance of Islam in regards to adopting children and if a child is with the family from his or her early days and develops a bond, do the laws of Mahram and Non-Mahram still have to be observed?","Adoption in the sense of claiming a child as your own son or daughter and getting official legal documents for him or her in your name is not permissible. 
However, there is no Ishkaal (objection) in taking care of a child, raising him or her and showing love and care, which is in itself rewarding but the child's lineage has to be preserved. 
In addition, the child would remain non-Mahram once reached the age of Buloogh (puberty). 
At the appropriate moment, the child should be informed about it (being adopted0 and if one cannot inform the child, he should record it somewhere or ask someone to bear witness that he/she is not his child.","Sistani"

What is your opinion about the beer (Maa al-Sha'eir) which is sold on the market normally with a label that reads ""alcohol free"".","The drink that is made from barley and called ""Fuqa' in Arabic is definitely forbidden and Najis (ritually impure) as an obligatory precaution. This drink is not intoxicant normally but it makes one feel tipsy; that is a state of slight drunkenness caused apparently by low percentage of alcohol in the liquid.
Therefore, if a drink is produced alcohol free in the first place and it is not called ""Fuqa"" (beer), there is no problem, or else, it is forbidden even if alcohol is separated from it.","Sistani"

"30",30,"

What is the philosophy of Azadari (mourning and lamentation) for Imam Husain?","There is no doubt that the tragedy of Kerbala, when ascribed to the killers, is a criminal and terrible act. However when ascribed to Husain (A) himself, it represents a conscious confrontation and a courageous resistance for a sacred cause. The whole nation had failed to stand up to Yazid. They had succumbed to his will, and deviation and regression towards the pre-Islamic ways were increasing.
Passiveness by Husain (A) in this situation would have meant the end of Islam as we know it. Thus Husain (A) took upon himself the responsibility of the whole nation. The greatest tragedy was that one who stood up for the noblest of causes, the defense of Islam, was cut down in so cruel a manner.
It is for this reason that the sacrifice of Husain (A) is commemorated annually throughout the Muslim world. Our sorrow never abates as we relive the tragedy.
The commemoration of Ashura on the 10th of Muharram every year serves to remind us of the sacrifices of the family of the Prophet (S). It also makes us aware of the people, then and now, who tried to destroy Islam and the family of the Prophet (S) and all that they stood for - as well as those who watched, listened and did nothing.","Sistani"

In certain cases, some governmental agencies demand that autopsy be performed on the body of the deceased to establish the cause of death. When is it permissible to agree to their demand and when is it not?","No heir of a deceased Muslim is allowed to give consent for autopsy to be carried out on the body of the deceased for the purpose mentioned above and other similar purposes; and it is necessary for him to prevent the autopsy if possible. Of course, if another important factor at play that of equal or more importance than this basic rule such as securing the life of an innocent individual Muslim, it is permissible .","Sistani"

What is the general ruling regards to artificial insemination?","There is no problem in it per se, however, since the process may involve masturbation, and implanting involves touching and seeing the private part, insemination would only be allowed when the parties involved may face difficulty in their life which is not normally bearable.
Also, regards to the matters of inheritance and Mahramiyat the parties involved need to refer to the specific Islamic Law rulings.","Sistani"

Due to a number of miscarriages, the doctors have stated due to my condition, I can no longer get pregnant, are we, as husbands and wives, able to use our own fertilised egg and use a ""surrogate mother"", to carry the feotus in their womb?","If the sperm and egg belong to the husband and wife and the inseminated egg is then implanted in another woman's womb, there is no problem. It is permissible per se. However, since implanting involves touching and seeing the private part, insemination would be allowed only when the parties to the marriage may face difficulty in their life which is not normally bearable. If this is the case, looking and touching would be allowed to the necessary extent.  
However, when it comes to who the child belongs to, the owner of the egg or the owner of the womb, that is a problematic issue. In any case, precaution has to be observed in inheritance. As for mahramiyah, the owner of sperm is the legal father and the owner of the egg is mahram (related) to the child because she is her father's wife and the owner of the womb is mahram to him because she is like his mother.","Sistani"

A man lived with a woman whom he intended to marry and also had sex with her without entering into a marriage contract (‘aqd); thereafter he married her in the proper religious way. Is their co-habitation before the ‘aqd considered marriage in the eyes of religious law? Does the subsequent ‘aqd have retroactive effect? What will be the status of the children born before the ‘aqd?","In [an Islamic] marriage, the spousal relationship is established by the verbal expression of the proposition and the acceptance (Nikah 'aqd). More over no action or deed that reflects the intention of marriage can be a substitute for the spoken words. Consequently, the marriage mentioned in the question is not valid except after the pronouncement of the religious marriage formula that does not have any retroactive effect.
As for the children, they will be considered legitimate if the parents did not know the law [requiring the ‘aqd] because their relationship will be classified as “wat’i bis-shubha”. But if both were aware of the law, their relationship is considered adulterous. Consequently the children will be deemed illegitimate. However, if only one knew about the law without the other, the children will be deemed legitimate in relation to the ignorant parent only.","Sistani"
"38",38,"

What is the meaning of the expression used by the jurists that “there is no waiting period (‘idda) for an adulterous woman because of her adultery”?","It means that she is allowed to marry after having committed adultery without observing the ‘idda; and, if she is married, then it is permissible for her husband to have sexual relations with her without observing the ‘idda, she would need to seek repentance and forgiveness.","Sistani"

It's also been mentioned that prayers in a place with a dog around is abominable (Makrooh).","Sistani"
"45",45,"

Does cat hair affect ones prayers?","If there is a few cat hairs (one to three) on a person's body or cloth, his prayer is in order but if there are more than that, his prayer becomes void, as an obligatory precaution.","Sistani"

What is the Islamic law about buying a car on installments? Many auto companies and authorized car selling agencies sell new and used cars on installments. Thus, when customers go to buy those cars, the companies refer them to certain institutions such as banks and insurance companies. The companies get back the capital as well as the interest in monthly installments stretched over a number of months or years. If someone fails to pay his installments on time, the company overcharges the defaulter.  The interest rate is determined on the basis of certain important factors such as the client's turnover, amount of income or timely-repayment of installments. The amount of interest generally paid is %, % or % or more or less. What is the Islam law with regard to buying a car on monthly installments keeping in view the foregoing details?"," If the loan providing companies first buy the cars from the agencies and then sell them to customers on installments with some increase (interest) as part of the prices of the cars, the transaction is in order. Indeed, if a penalty is imposed due to a customer failing to make payment on time, it is forbidden (haram). 
And if it means that the companies or agencies themselves sell the cars to customers, and in return the loan providing company gives the price of the cars to their manufacturers or agencies, and receives more money on installments from the customer, it is forbidden.","Sistani"

The Muslim communities in non-Muslim countries are increasing day by day.

And if the deceased has no heir or the heir is refusing to fulfill his duty or is not capable, it is obligatory, on the basis of kifã’i, upon other Muslims [to bury the deceased in an appropriate place].

What is the proper definition of 'backbiting'? Please, give some references from the Quran and Hadith also.","Backbiting means “speaking ill of a believer in their absence of someone with the purpose of disparaging him, no matter whether the alleged shortcoming was related to his body, lineage, behaviour, deeds, statements, religion, or life, and other defects which are [usually] concealed from the people. Similarly, it does not matter whether the description was done by words or by gesture.”
Almighty Allãh condemned backbiting in His noble Book and has described it such that mind and body feel abhorrence towards it. He said, “And some of you should not backbite the others: would anyone of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? No, you abhor it.” (49:12)
The Prophet (s.a.w.) said, “Be careful of backbiting because backbiting is worse than adultery, in that a person who commits adultery can repent and ask forgiveness from God, and Allãh can forgive him whereas Allãh will not forgive the backbiter until the person who was at the receiving end forgives him.”","Sistani"
"70",70,"

An elderly person has a habit of doing gheebat and it is very difficult for me to stop him and I also do not want to hear but I am forced to.

If I do gheebah of a believer is it obligatory for me to tell them about it and ask them to forgive me?

Some governments and some companies in non-Muslim as well as Muslim, countries deposit the salaries of their employees directly into their accounts in the banks. The employee does not get the money in his hand, although he can withdraw it whenever he wants. Now, if the statement of his account shows that the money has surpassed his annual expenses, is khums obligatory on it?","Khums is payable on what has surpassed his annual needs, except in the case of a government employee in a Muslim state that deposits his salary into a state or private bank. In the latter case, Khums would not be obligatory on the salary that has been deposited in the bank until he [physically] takes possession of it with the permission of the Mujtahid. Then the salary will be included in his income of that year and Khums will become obligatory on what is in excess to that year’s expenses.","Sistani"
"156",156,"

It is permissible to deposit money with national banks, in other words loaning the banks?","This, however, must be done without making a provision for charging interest on the money deposited, meaning not stipulating that the banks should give an undertaking to pay the interest on the loan. The opposite of this is that the depositor reaches a conclusion that if the bank was not going to pay the interest, he would not demand it. The intent to demand the interest does not contradict the non-stipulation. Similarly, the intent not to demand the interest does not contradict stipulation. That is because each of which is alien to the other. 
Given that the bank is governmental, if he receives any interest, he should give half of the interest to faithful needy Shia Muslims and use the other half.","Sistani"

What is the ruling on saying Salam Alaykum to the disbelievers?","There is no harm in initiating the salutation, albeit Makrooh (undesirable act) except out of necessity, under whose remit comes Urf. Responding to their Salam should be by uttering [the word] Alayk (with you).","Sistani"

What is the rulings of His Eminence Grand Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Sistani (May Allah protect him) on sighting of the new moon crescent and determining the st day of the month?","Sighting of the new moon is ascertained by knowledge of the actual sighting or through solid news of such sighting, or some other means. Certainty can also be achieved through common knowledge. Amongst other sources of ascertaining the sighting of the new moon is the lapse of thirty days on Sha’ban’s crescent for the start of Ramadhan to be confirmed, or thirty days on the crescent of Ramadhan for the new moon of Shawwal to be confirmed [and so on]. Sighting can also be confirmed by the evidence of two witnesses of impeccable character (adl).
However, sighting of the new moon is not recognised by the evidence of women, or by the evidence of one just witness, even with oath, or by the words of astrologers. Neither by its absence after dawn dusk, so that it could be said that it belongs to a previous night, nor by the evidence of two just witnesses, if the evidence is not confined to their own sighting of the newly born moon. Sighting is not recognised too when it is seen before zawaal so that the day of sighting be from the ensuing month. The impression of a ring it may give, proving that it could belong to a previous night, cannot be accepted as well.","Sistani"
"161",161,"

What is the proof of sighting the moon?","The evidence could be one or more of the following:
1. You have sighted it yourself (without binoculars or a telescope).
2. The testimony of two men of impeccable character, provided that you do not have any knowledge of instances that they may be wrong, and that you do not dispute their testimony.
3. The lapse of thirty days on the month of Sha’ban, thus reaching certitude that Sha’ban has come to an end and that Ramadhan shall commence.
4. When the news of the birth of the moon of Ramadhan becomes commonplace that you are sure of the sighting.","Sistani"

There is this vinegar that is made from wine, in the sense that it was wine and then, through a manufacturing process, changed into vinegar. Therefore, the label on the bottle reads: “wine vinegar” as opposed to the vinegar made from barley or other items. One of the signs [of differentiating between “wine vinegar” and the wine itself is that] the bottles of this vinegar are displayed in the area of vinegar, and it has never happened that these bottles are placed on the shelves of wines. Moreover, there is no difference between such vinegar and the vinegar made from dates for example. So, can this wine which has turned into vinegar be considered vinegar under the rule of change (istihalah)?","If the name “vinegar” can be applied in the view of common people upon that product, as has been assumed in the question, the same rule governing vinegar would apply to it.

In matters of religious laws, apart from the ones clearly defined, or ones which are indisputable, a person must act according to the verdicts (Fatwa) of the most learned Mujtahid. ","Sistani"
"206",206,"

What are the ways through which I can identify the most learned of Mujtahids?","There are three ways of identifying a Mujtahid, and the A'alam:
    * when a person is certain that a particular person is a Mujtahid, or the most learned one. For this, he should be a learned person himself, and should possess the capacity to identify a Mujtahid or an A'alam;
    * when two persons, who are learned and just and possess the capacity to identify a Mujtahid or the A'alam, confirm that a person is a Mujtahid or an A'lam, provided that two other learned and just persons do not contradict them. In fact, being a Mujt ahid or an A'lam can also be established by a statement of only one trusted and reliable person;
    * when a number of learned persons who possess the capacity to identify a Mujtahid or an A'lam, certify that a particular person is a Mujtahid or an A'lam, provided that one is satisfied by their statement.","Sistani"

A person is said to be just whe n he performs all those acts which are obligatory upon him, and refrains from all those things which are forbidden to him. And the sign of being just is that one is apparently of a good character, so that if enquiries are made about him from the people of his locality, or from his neighbours, or from those persons with whom he lives, they would confirm his good conduct. And if one knows that the verdicts of the Mujtahids differ with regard to the problems which we face in every day life, it is necessary t hat the Mujtahid who is followed be A'lam (the most learned), who is more capable of understanding the divine laws than any of the contemporary Mujtahids.","Sistani"
"208",208,"

What does Taqlid mean?","Taqlid means acting according to the opinion of the jurist (mujtahid) who has all the necessary qualification to be emulated. So you do what the mujtahid's expert opinion says you should do, and refrain from what his expert opinion says you should refrain from without any research [in Islamic sources] on your part. It is as though you have placed the responsibility of your deeds squarely on his shoulders.
Among the conditions which must be found in a jurist (mujtahid) who can be followed is that he must be the most learned (al-a'lam) jurist of his time and the most capable in deriving the religious laws from the appropriate sources.","Sistani"

This should, however, be commensurate with what is generally accepted in these circumstances. If he fears that fasting might be harmful to him, it is permissible to break his fast. And if his illness continues until the next Ramadhan, Qadha is not obligatory but he should give 750 grams of food (wheat, flour or bread or any kind of food) for each day to poor Shiites. If he recovers within the same year, only Qadha is obligatory on him and he will not have to pay kaffara.
As for a patient whose health is not affected by fasting, he must fast and his fasting is in order.","Sistani"
"232",232,"

I am suffering from a problem with my kidney. Dehydration will affect my kidney and worsen my health problem. What is my duty about fasting?","You cannot fast in the said case. If your problem continues until the next Ramadhan, Qadha is also not obligatory either; you should give one mudd of food stuffs as fidya for each day.  One mudd is equal to 750 grams.","Sistani"
"233",233,"

I am pregnant and would like to know whether I should fast or not.","Fasting is not obligatory on a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, for whom fasting is harmful or for the child she carries. For every day, however, she should give one mudd (750 grams) of food to poor. In both the cases, she has to give qadha for the fasts which are left out.
Also, if a woman who is not in an advanced stage of pregnancy but fasting is harmful or unbearably difficult, fasting is not wajib on her. She must keep the qadha later and there is no kaffara on her.
In both case, if a woman fails to observe the Qadha of the missed fast until next Ramadhan, she must, as an obligatory precaution, give another kaffara because of delaying the Qadha. ","Sistani"
"234",234,"

There is a woman who is breastfeeding her child and the child is dependent on the milk it is receiving from its mother. Can the mother break her fast since she fears for her child? Is it permissible for her not to fast?","If a woman is suckling a child, whether she is the mother or a nurse, or suckles it free, and the quantity of her milk is small, and if fasting is harmful to her or to the child, it will not be obligatory on her to fast. And she should give one mudd of food stuffs (wheat or flour or noodles) per day to poor.
In both the cases, she will later give qadha for the fasts left out. But this rule is specifically applicable in a circumstance where this is the only way of feeding milk to the child - (as an obligatory precaution). But if there is an alternative, like, when more than one woman offer to suckle the child, then establishing this rule is a matter of Ishkal.","Sistani"
"235",235,"

What is the Islamic ruling about someone who does not fast intentionally or breaks his fast deliberately?","He should repent and seek divine forgiveness and it is necessary for him to observe the Qadha of the fasts which he has left out. As for kaffara (penalty), the details are as follows: 
If a person breaks his fast by eating or drinking or sexual intercourse without knowing that he must fast or was certain that fasting is not obligatory on him or broke his fast due to inculpable ignorance (ignorance out of innocence), it is not obligatory to give kaffarah (penalty). In case, however, he was guilty of not learning the rules, then kaffara is obligatory on him, as an obligatory precaution. 
In case he broke his fast and was fully conscious of his duty to observe fast or that he was aware that what he is doing invalidates the fast, kaffara becomes obligatory.  The kaffara is to feed sixty poor even if he has broken his fast with something haram. 
If he knew that it was necessary to observe Qadha in the same year but he did not observe the Qadha till next Ramadhan, he should give 750 grams of food stuffs (such as flour, bread, noodles or date etc.) as kaffara for each day. 
If a person cannot observe the Qadha due to illness or other problems that hinder him from observing the Qadha, he should leave a Will asking his relatives to observe the Qadha on his behalf. ","Sistani"
"236",236,"

What is the Islam ruling in regards to someone who attained the age of puberty but he/she did not fast? Does he/she have to give kaffara in addition to the Qadha of the fasts?","If he thinks that he did not know the meaning of taklif (obligation) at that time or considers probable that he was certain that eating was allowed, observing the Qadha of the skipped fast only is sufficient.","Sistani"
"237",237,"

How is puberty confirmed?","Puberty in males could be confirmed if one of three signs was present.
1. First: Completion of fifteen lunar calendar years of age (equal to 14 years and seven months and fifteen days of the solar calendar).
2. Second: Ejaculation through sexual intercourse, or seminal discharge while awake or asleep.
3.Third: The presence of pubic hair, of the rough type, similar to head hair.
4. Fourth: The presence of hair on the face and above the lips.","Sistani"

When is a girl considered adult from the viewpoint of Sharia?","She is considered adult at the completion of nine lunar years (equal to eight years and eight months and twenty days of the solar calendar).","Sistani"
"239",239,"

I masturbated in Ramadhan and I did not know that masturbation is haram. How should I go about my previous fasts?","If you knew in the beginning that masturbation is haram and that it invalidates fasting, you should observe qadha and give kaffara. The kaffara is to either feed sixty poor and needy Shia people or fast for sixty days (31 days in a row).  If you did not know the hukm (ruling) and masturbated due to inculpable (innocent) ignorance, your fast is in order and qadha is not necessary.","Sistani"
"240",240,"

Does masturbating during daytime of Ramadhan invalidate the fast, regardless of whether or not it leads to ejaculation? What is the penalty that should be incurred by one who does so? What is the ruling for a woman who engages in masturbation during daytime of Ramadhan, irrespective of whether or not it leads to discharge?","If a person masturbates with the intention of ejaculating and actually ejaculates, his fast is rendered invalid and he must make it up by way of qadha as well as pay the penalty (kaffara) which is fasting for two successive months or feeding sixty poor people. If he masturbates with the intention of ejaculating but does not ejaculate, he must complete the fast with the intention of pleasing the Almighty and then do it qadha.
If he masturbates without the intention of ejaculating and he does not normally ejaculate, knowing that discharge is probable and it actually happens —he has to do qadha without the penalty. However, if such a person was confident that no discharge would take place and it actually happens — no qadha is required. In all these cases, there is no difference between a man and a woman.","Sistani"
"241",241,"

If a person indulges in foreplay without the intention of allowing the semen to be discharged, will his fast become void?","If a fasting person indulges in courtship without the intention of allowing the semen to be discharged, and also, if he is sure that semen will not be discharged, his fast is in order, even if semen may be discharged unexpectedly. However, if he is not sure about the discharge and it takes place, then his fast is void.","Sistani"
"242",242,"

A believer fasts but does not know that intentionally getting into state of janabat invalidates fasting—what should he do [when he finds out]?","It is obligatory on him to make up those fasts; however, there is no penalty on him as long as he was [erroneously] convinced that being in a state of janabah does not invalidate fast or was unaware of that ruling.","Sistani"
"243",243,"

If a person ejaculates in his sleep, does his fast become void?","If a person observing fast knows that if he sleeps during the day time he will become Mohtalim (i.e. semen will be discharged from his body during sleep) it is permissible for him to sleep, even if he may not be inconvenienced by not sleeping. And if he becomes Mohtalim, his fast does not become void.","Sistani"
"244",244,"

A discharges fluid when she starts thinking about her husband or when seeing something simply exciting? Does the emission make her fast void?","The fluid which a woman feels during foreplay or lustful thinking but it is not much to spread to other parts, is clean. Ghusl does not become obligatory in this case and it does not make wudhu void either but if there is much fluid and is called ejaculation and the fluid spreads to the underwear and this normally takes place during orgasm and full satisfaction, the fluid is najis (impure) and in this case ghusl becomes obligatory. In fact, if emission takes place without orgasm, the necessary precaution is that it is najis and it causes janabah.
Hence, if a woman enters the state of janabah intentionally with the details mentioned above, both Qadha and kaffara become obligatory on her. The obligatory precaution is that she should restrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. ","Sistani"
"246",246,"

If a person gives me a gift from which he has not paid Khums, is it necessary for me to pay Khums on it?","The person who recieves the gift is not required to pay anything. Yes, it is obligatory to pay Khums from it, if a year runs over it.","Sistani"
"252",252,"

A privately owned bank invited its customers to deposit money with the bank, say one thousand Dirhams that they can withdraw at any time. After some time the bank shall give a specific gift to the depositors. Is it permissible to enter into such a deal to get the gift?","Depositing money with the condition of [getting] the gift is haraam. The condition here means you make the [transaction] of depositing contingent on an undertaking given by the bank to give the gift. If it was just for the knowledge that the bank shall give the gift, it is not going to dent the permissibility of depositing and that of receiving the granted gift as halal.","Sistani"
"253",253,"

A national bank (in a Muslim country) offers a project to its clients in which a person deposits a sum of money in the order of , dirhams as a deposit which can be withdrawn at any time. It announces that after a period of time, a lottery will be drawn and the bank will grant a specific gift to the investors. Is it permissible to deposit with this intention?","Depositing with the condition of a gift is usury and therefore prohibited. By condition is meant to make the deposit with the requirement that the bank should give the gift. But the mere knowledge that the bank will grant it (gift) does not harm the permissibility of investing and the lawfulness of the granted gift.","Sistani"
"254",254,"

How is a Tartibi (sequential) Ghusl done?","In this method of Ghusl, a person should first make a Niyyat (intention) for Ghusl. Thereafter one should first wash one's head and neck, and thereafter the remaining parts of one's body. It is better that one washes the right part of the body first and then the left part. Furthermore, based on obligatory precaution, it is not sufficient to make the intention of Ghusl when moving the head, neck or body while they are already under the flow of water, rather, the part that one wants to perform Ghusl on - in the event that it is already under the flow of water - must be taken out from under the flow of water and then washed with the intention of Ghusl.","Sistani"
"255",255,"

Is it necessary to clean the body from impurities before performing an obligatory Ghusl?","It is not necessary that the entire body of a person should be clean before Irtimasi and Tartibi Ghusl.

"258",258,"

If a person is doing Ghusl-e-Janabat Irtimasi, must he say ""I perform Ghusl-e-Janabat Irtimasi"" in his Niyah? If not, is, saying ""I perform Ghusl-e-Janabat"" enough?","It is sufficient to intend getting nearness to Allah by getting Taharah. [Meaning, it is not necessary to mention your intention verbally. To pass it through your mind that you perform Ghusl Janaba is sufficient.] You should perform Ghusl with the intention of complying with the order of Allah.","Sistani"
"259",259,"

Can a person Perform Ghusl-e-Irtimasi instead of Ghusl-e-Tartibi, in order to save time, even if he has enough time to perform the latter?","There is no objection in it.","Sistani"
"260",260,"

There was little time remaining for Fajr prayers, and I was performing Ghusl Janabat, once I completed my Ghusl I realised my prayer has become Qadha, is my Ghusl valid, and can I perform my prayers with it?","Yes, the Ghusl is valid, and you can perform prayers with the Ghusl of Janaba,","Sistani"

This prohibition applies, as a matter of obligatory precaution, even if it was extracted from animal bones.
Of course, if a chemical change occurs in the original ingredients during the process of manufacturing the gelatin, there is no problem at all in eating it.

The Muslim communities in non-Muslim countries are increasing day by day.

And if the deceased has no heir or the heir is refusing to fulfill his duty or is not capable, it is obligatory, on the basis of kifã’i, upon other Muslims [to bury the deceased in an appropriate place].

A Muslim dies in a non-Muslim city that has no Muslim graveyard and the family of the deceased cannot transfer the body to a Muslim country because it cannot afford the cost of transportation.

And is this obligatory upon the Muslims who reside in that city?","If burying the deceased in an appropriate grave in that same city or other city (excluding non-Muslim graveyards) depends on spending some money, and neither has he left any estate that can pay for it nor are the heirs capable of providing for it—then it is wãjib kifã’i upon the Muslims to provide for it.

Pilgrims are faced with one more problem regarding slaughtering, the animals slaughtered [in Mina] are wasted in spite of the fact that there are many poor people amongst us spread all over the Muslim countries who go without tasting meat for days!

So what is the solution?","It is obligatory to ascertain in order to do the slaughtering inside Mina. If it is not possible because of overcrowding in Mina, it is permissible to do it in the valley of Muhassar. Moreover, the timing of slaughtering is not restricted to the day of Eid; it can be done till the last day of the days of tashríq [i.e., till the 13th of Dhu ’l-Hijja].","Sistani"

Is it permissible to put on the ihrãm for hajj from the city of Jeddah? If it is not permissible, what should one do since the plane lands in Jeddah?","Jeddah is neither a miqãt nor parallel to any of the miqãts; therefore, it is not in order to put on the ihrãm from there for ‘umrah or hajj. However, if one knows that between Jeddah and the Haram [the holy territory around Mecca], there is a place which is parallel to one of the miqãts —this is not improbable, if one looks for a parallel of Juhfah— he can put on the ihrãm from there by offering nadhr.

I did not know that Tawaf al-Nisa was obligatory for every individual who performs Umrah or Hajj al-Tamattu'.  I have not performed it. What should I do know given the fact that I have left Makkah for my country?","If you cannot go back to perform Tawaf al-Nisa, you should ask someone in Makkah to perform Tawaf al-Nisa.

I would appreciate, if you kindly tell me the necessary conditions by which a person becomes Mustati' (financially and bodily capable). I am asking this question because I really want to know whether or not I am qualified for Hajj.","Hajj is obligatory on a person once in his lifetime, provided that he fulfils the following conditions:
I. Being Baligh (adult).
II. Being sane and free.
III. Because of proceeding to Mecca for Hajj, should not be obliged to commit a Haram act, avoidance of which is more important than Hajj, nor should he be compelled to forsake an obligatory work which is more important than Hajj.
He should be capable of performing Hajj, and this depends upon a number of factors:
(a) He should possess provisions as described in relevant books and means for transportation, if need be, or he should have enough money to buy them, or get tickets.
(b) He should be healthy and strong enough to go to Mecca and perform Hajj.
(c) There should be no obstacle on the way. If the way is closed, or if a person fears that he will lose his life, or honor, while on his way to Mecca, or he will be robbed of his property, it is not obligatory on him to perform Hajj. But if he can reach Mecca by another route, he should go to perform Hajj, even if the other route is a longer one. But that route should not be unusually longer.

It becomes permissible for us as Muslims to eat from their food no matter whether they touched it with their wet hands or not as long as we do not know or are not sure that it consists of what is forbidden to us, like intoxicating drinks.

Some women use certain pills to delay the onset of their monthly period so as to be able to perform their religious obligations, such as fasting and hajj  rituals. These pills upset the equilibrium of hormones in the body, which in turn affect the period, rendering it irregular, so much so that the duration, when the woman is tahir, is some ten days or more or slightly less. It is worth noting that the type of blood, of menstruation during this time, is identical to that which the woman witnesses during her regular period.
What is the ruling on this matter?","If the number of days of her being Tahir is ten days or more, the blood that appears before this duration and that which follows it should be treated as two separate Haydh  (menstruation). 
Should the duration of being Tahir be less than ten days, and the total of the two bloods and the intervening Tahir duration are more than ten days, the blood that coincides with the days of the period, not the other one, is considered Haydh, the other Istihadha (undue menses), as a matter of course, except when that which is in the period is ahead, and the second blood bears the characteristics of Haydh. In this case the part which is not exceeding ten days is allotted to the first haydh, even if it does not coincide with the days of period and the woman not being of an irregular period. If any one of them fulfils the conditions of period, she must consider the one that does as Haydh and the other, that does not, Istihadha.

A person is said to be just when he performs all those acts which are obligatory upon him, and refrains from all those things which are forbidden to him. And the sign of being just is that one is apparently of a good character, so that if enquiries are made about him from the people of his locality, or from his neighbours, or from those persons with whom he lives, they would confirm his good conduct. And if one knows that the verdicts of the Mujtahids differ with regard to the problems which we face in every day life, it is necessary that the Mujtahid who is followed be A'lam (the most learned), who is more capable of understanding the divine laws than any of the contemporary Mujtahids.","Sistani"

*When two persons, who are learned and just and possess the capacity to identify a Mujtahid or the A'alam, confirm that a person is a Mujtahid or an A'lam, provided that two other learned and just persons do not contradict them. In fact, being a Mujtahid or an A'lam can also be established by a statement of only one trusted and reliable person;
*When a number of learned persons who possess the capacity to identify a Mujtahid or an A'lam, certify that a particular person is a Mujtahid or an A'lam, provided that one is satisfied by their statement.","Sistani"

It is permissible to marry her temporarily after her divorce and after the completion of the ‘idda from her non-Muslim husband. (The period of her ‘idda is not different from the ‘idda of a Muslim woman.) Therefore, it is not permissible before the completion of the ‘idda.

And the fluid that sometimes comes out after the ejaculation of semen, called ‘wadhi’, is also pure, and does not require ghusl.

However, if the discharged fluid is a lot – to the extent that it can be called an ‘ejaculation’ and it dirties clothing – then in case it is discharged when the woman reaches sexual climax and complete sexual satisfaction (orgasm), it is impure and causes Janabah. In fact, even if it is not discharged at that moment, based on obligatory precaution it is impure and causes janabah. And whenever a woman doubts whether or not a discharge of fluid was to this extent, or she doubts whether or not fluid was discharged at all, performing Ghusl is not obligatory on her and nor does it invalidate Wu<U+1E0D>u<U+02BE> and Ghusl.","Sistani"

In the latter case, khums would not be obligatory on the salary that has been deposited in the bank until he [physically] takes possession of it.

The same rule would apply if he forgot [that he had the wallet or the belt on him] and remembered during prayer, provided that his forgetfulness was not a result of carelessness and indifference.

Just as many questions are asked about halãl and harãm music, many questions are asked about halãl and harãm songs. Is it correct to say that harãm songs are those that arouse sexual, lustful urges and promote unstable and degrading behaviour? Is it correct to say that songs that do not arouse lustful desires, but elevate the souls and thoughts to lofty levels like religious songs of praise dedicated to the Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) and the Imams (a.s.), or the songs that lift the spirits and morale [of the fighters] and the like are halãl songs?","All songs (al-ghinã’) are harãm. Based on the definition that we accept, al-ghinã’ is the entertaining expression by way of tunes that are common to those who provide entertainment and amusement.  In this prohibition, we should include the recitation of the Holy Qur’ãn, supplications (du‘ãs), and songs of praise of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) uttered to the accompaniment of those tunes [that are used by the entertainers]. The prohibition of reciting other non-entertaining expressions —like songs intended to lift the morale [of fighters]— is based on compulsory precaution. However, the tune that cannot be described as such is not harãm by itself.","Sistani"

If it is not permissible to remain in such a country, would his efforts in propagation among the Muslims (reminding them of their obligations and encouraging them to refrain from haram) change the rule for him and allow him to remain in that country?","It is not haram to stay in that country, if it does not create hurdles for him and his family in fulfilling their religious obligations presently as well as in future; otherwise, it would not be permissible even if he is engaged in some kind of propagation activities. And Allah knows the best.","Sistani"

Is it wajib on the immigrants in Europe and America (and other similar countries) to strive for teaching their children Arabic, and that ignorance of Arabic may lead in the future to ignorance of the main Islamic body of knowledge, and that will naturally lead to less familiarity with religious teachings and loss of faith?","To teach them Arabic is wajib only to the extent which is necessary for performing their religious duties that have to be done in Arabic (e.g., recitation of the Opening chapter of the Qur'an, a second chapter, and other wajib recitations in salat). Teaching more than that is not wajib as long as it is possible to provide them with religious knowledge in a foreign language.
Of course, it is recommended to teach them the holy Qur'an [in Arabic]; rather it is important to teach them Arabic in a precise form so that they may benefit from the basic sources of Islamic teachings, especially, and foremost among them, after the holy Qur'an, is the Prophetic sunna and the sayings of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be with them all).","Sistani"
"437",437,"

If a religious preacher who is mindful of his faith starts facing more situations where he commits haram deeds because of the social environment (e.g., nudity and indecent exposures), is it haram for him to stay in those countries; that is, should he stop propagation (tabligh) and return to his own country?","If he indulges in some minor sins occasionally, then it is not haram for him to stay in that country, provided that he is confident that he would not be tempted to commit more serious sins.","Sistani"

"439",439,"

Sometimes a Muslim residing in Europe and America (and other similar places) indulges in haram activities that he would not have done, if he remained in his Muslim country. The manifestations of temptation in non-Muslim societies may attract a Muslim to committing haram deeds even if he is not inclined towards them. Does this come under the banner of ""loss of faith"" that makes it haram for him to stay in that country?","Yes; unless the sins he sometimes indulges in, and without insisting upon them, they are of the minor category.","Sistani"
"440",440,"

A believer residing in Europe, America and other similar countries feels estranged from the religious environment in which he was born and raised. Neither does he hear the voice of the Qur'an [recited from mosques] nor the sound of the adhan coming [from the minarets]; and there are no holy shrines, and their spiritual atmosphere, that he can visit. Is leaving such an Islamic environment of his country and its positive aspects considered ""loss of faith""?","This is not the loss of faith that would make residing in a non-Muslim country haram for that person. However, staying away from such a religious environment may, with the passage of time, weaken the religious resolve of the immigrant to an extent that he may consider negligence of wajib deeds and committing of sins as insignificant. If a person has this fear that he might lose the faith in this manner, then it is not permissible for him to take residence in that country.","Sistani"
"441",441,"

What is the meaning of at-ta'arrub ba'd al-hijra which is one of the major sins?","Some jurists have said that during our time, it applies to residing in countries that may cause the loss of faith. It means the migration of a person from a country -where it is possible for him to learn the obligatory religious teachings and laws, and where it is possible for him to fulfill his obligations and refrain from what is forbidden- to a country where this possibility does not exist fully or partially.","Sistani"

"443",443,"

When a person is diagnosed as having ADIS, is it permissible for the doctor or is it obligatory on him to inform the patient’s relatives, especially their spouse?","It is permissible to inform them, if the patient or his guardian gives consent. It is obligatory if the survival —for a longer time span— of the patient depends on it. It is similarly obligatory, if he knows that by not informing them, the virus would infect them for not taking necessary precautions.","Sistani"
"444",444,"

"446",446,"

What is the ruling on abortion for a pregnant woman who is infected with AIDS?","It is not permissible, more so after the soul has entered the feotus.

What is the ruling concerning the right of the non-infected spouse in seeking separation?","If deception was involved in the marriage, in the sense that the husband or the wife concealed the fact that they had AIDS at the time of proposing, engagement, so much that  the marriage contract (‘aqd) was recited based on that understanding, the deceived party has the right of annulment.
However, if the wife or her representative did not say anything about the issue of the disease and the husband assumed that she is free from it, the silence does not count as deception and, it therefore, does not yield the right of annulment.
If there was no deception or the disease flared up after the marriage, the non-infected husband has the right to divorcing his infected wife. Does the non-infected wife have the right to ask for divorce from her infected husband on the grounds that she is being deprived of her conjugal rights?
There are two views [on this]; precaution should not be ruled out in this case. Of course, if her husband abandons her completely and she becomes like a suspended woman [neither married nor unmarried], it is permissible for her to take her case to the religious judge* to force her husband to choose one of two courses: either end the abandonment or divorce her.","Sistani"
"448",448,"

What is the ruling on the sexual relations of an AIDS patient? Is it permissible for  a non-infected person to refuse sexual relation with their spouse because sexual intercourse is one of the main ways of transmitting the virus?","It is permissible for a non-infected wife not to make herself available to her infected husband for intimacy that could lead to infection by the virus. It is indeed obligatory on her to prevent him from such intimacy.
If it is possible to lessen the chances of infection to a level that is insignificant —for example, 2%— by using condom, etc, it is permissible for her to be intimate with her husband. In such a case, it is, based on precaution, not permissible for her to refuse [intimate relations with her husband].
This clarifies also the case of a husband who is not a carrier of the virus and wife whose: it is not permissible for him to have sexual relations with her in accordance with what sensible people perceive as considerable risk— of being infected by the virus. In such a case, the wife’s right to have sexual relations [at least once] every four months is suspended, except when it becomes possible to adopt methods that would properly prevent infection with the virus.","Sistani"

Is it permissible for a person infected with AIDS to marry a person who is free from it?","Yes; but it is not permissible for him or her to mislead the other party by deliberately presenting himself or herself as free from AIDS at the time of proposing while they are not. Similarly, it is not permissible for him or her to become intimate in a way that would infect the other partner.
However, if there is only a probability of infection and no certainty, then it is not obligatory for him or her to refrain from intimacy, provided that there is agreement on it.","Sistani"
"451",451,"

What is the rule on intentionally infecting others with the AIDS virus?","This is not allowed. If it leads —even after the passage of time— to the death of the person who has been infected, then the heirs of the deceased have the right of retribution from the person responsible for causing to demand the infecting, provided that the latter was aware that that infection could lead to death; but if he was ignorant of that effect, or unaware of it, at that time, only indemnity (blood money) and penalty would apply.","Sistani"

Some Western governments allow the daughter to be independent of her parents, after she has passed the age of sixteen. If she seeks her parents advice, it is only for seeking their opinion or out of respect for them. Is such a virgin girl allowed to marry, be it permanent or a temporary marriage, without the consent of her father?","If this means that the father has allowed her to marry whomsoever she wants or that he has withdrawn from interfering in the matter of her marriage, it is permissible for her to do so; otherwise, based on obligatory precaution, it is not permissible.","Sistani"

Is it not necessary that most possible numbers of deserving people should be helped from sahm-e Imam?","Although providing for the marriage of needy believers is among the avenues covered by  the portion of the Imam (a.s.), one is not permitted to utilize it for this or its other purposes without the permission of the marja‘ or his representative.

Can we eat that meat, if it comes from Muslim companies in non-Muslim countries? And what is the ruling, if the source is non-Muslim company from a non-Muslim country?","The writing [on the package] has no value at all.

Meat companies slaughter a large number of chickens at one time [that is, simultaneously]. Now if the person running the slaughtering machine is a Muslim, who says takbír and says the name of Allãh only once at the time of slaughtering all the chicken [simultaneously], is it permissible for us to eat those chickens? If we have doubt about these chickens being halãl, can we [ignore that doubt and] eat them and consider them pure (tãhir)?","If he repeats the name of Allãh as long as the machine is continuing to slaughter, it is sufficient.

Commercial fishing vessels place their huge nets [in the sea] and catch tons of fish which are then sold in the markets. It is well known that modern methods of fishing are based on catching the fish alive, and that the fishermen throw the dead fish back into the water for fear of contamination.
Therefore, is it permissible for us to buy such fish in the markets of non-Muslims? Is it permissible for us to buy such fish from Muslims who are not considerate of religious laws? In both the cases to ascertain that this particular fish in front of me was taken out of the water alive, should seek the advice of an expert and reliable witness to testify to that fact which may prove difficult, impractical, and unrealistic.
So, is there a solution for practicing Muslims who face difficulty in ascertaining whether or not the meat of chicken, cow or sheep is halãl, and therefore take to eating fish instead?","There is no problem in buying it from Muslims or non-Muslims; as there is no problem in eating it, if they are satisfied that the fish was caught by the method mentioned above and that it belongs to the category of scale fish.","Sistani"

What is the philosophy of Azadari (mourning and lamentation) for Imam Husain?","There is no doubt that the tragedy of Kerbala, when ascribed to the killers, is a criminal and terrible act. However when ascribed to Husain (A) himself, it represents a conscious confrontation and a courageous resistance for a sacred cause. The whole nation had failed to stand up to Yazid. They had succumbed to his will, and deviation and regression towards the pre-Islamic ways were increasing. Passiveness by Husain (A) in this situation would have meant the end of Islam as we know it. Thus Husain (A) took upon himself the responsibility of the whole nation. The greatest tragedy was that one who stood up for the noblest of causes, the defense of Islam, was cut down in so cruel a manner. It is for this reason that the sacrifice of Husain (A) is commemorated annually throughout the Muslim world. Our sorrow never abates as we relive the tragedy. The commemoration of Ashura on the 10th of Muharram every year serves to remind us of the sacrifices of the family of the Prophet (S). It also makes us aware of the people, then and now, who tried to destroy Islam and the family of the Prophet (pbuh) and all that they stood for - as well as those who watched, listened and did nothing.","Sistani"

Please let me know Friday Prayer is mustahab or wajib and whether it is sufficient for Zuhr prayer? Kindly, answer with details.","Friday prayers consists of 2 Rak'ats like Fajr prayers.

Namaz-e-Jumuah is Wajib Takhyiri, which means that we have an option to offer Jumuah prayers, if its necessary conditions are fulfilled, or to offer Zuhr prayers.

I am  years old and a convert to Islam of five months. My question is, being a practitioner of Twelver Jaf'ari Islam is it permissible for me to pray behind a Sunni Imam for Salaatul-Jummah and for regular congregational prayers, and is it required to prostrate on Turbah inside a mosque?","Taking part in Friday and congregational prayers of the Ahl-e Sunnat is permissible in areas where Taqiyah (dissimulation) is required. If you are not going to face a problem, you should, as far as possible, prostrate on a stone or anything upon which Sajda (prostration) is permissible. Prostration on carpets in the case of Taqiyah or out of necessity is permissible and there would be no objection in it. But if you are not offering your prayers with them out of Taqiyah it is not necessary to attend their congregational prayers and you can offer your prayers separately.","Sistani"
"512",512,"

Which is better, prayering in congregation or praying individually?","Praying in congregation (jama'at) is preferable to praying individually. Its preference is stronger in the dawn, sunset and night prayers. A noble hadith says: ""A salat [in congregation] behind a learned scholar is like [praying] a thousand cycles; and behind a Qurayshi is like [praying] a hundred cycles."" As the number of the worshippers increases, the preference [and the reward] also increases.","Sistani"
"513",513,"

Which is preferred for a woman, praying at home individually or praying in jama'ah (congregation) in a mosque?","It is recommended for women to attend congregational prayers as evidenced by an authentic tradition from the Commander of the Faithful, Ali (AS) that women used to attend congregational prayers but they were ordered to linger their sajda (prostration)  because some men were wearing tight garments but there is another authentic tradition which says that a woman's prayer at home is more virtuous than her prayer in a mosque. However, the conclusion that can be drawn from both traditions is that a woman's prayer at a place where she is not seen by non-mahram men (strangers) is more virtuous. If she can perform her prayers in a mosque without being seen by strangers, the prayer in a mosque would be more virtuous in that case. God knows best.","Sistani"

2. The testimony of two men of impeccable character, provided that you do not have any knowledge of instances that they may be wrong, and that you do not dispute their testimony.
3. The lapse of thirty days on the month of Sha’ban, thus reaching certitude that Sha’ban has come to an end and that Ramadhan shall commence.
4. When the news of the birth of the moon of Ramadhan becomes commonplace that you are sure of the sighting.","Sistani"

I felt so humble and said to my father, “It is time I should fast the month of Ramadhan, and I shall start this year. However, what is the way to knowing that the month has started?","You should be able to know that by sighting the new moon in your country or nearby countries that share the same horizon; in other words, if the crescent is sighted in one country, it should be seen in the other, were it not for natural barriers, such as clouds, mountainous terrain, and the like.","Sistani"
"523",523,"

If Ramadhan crescent is sighted in one city would it suffice the sighting in another city?","Should the new moon be sighted in a city, it would suffice the sighting in another city, provided the two fall on the same horizon. That is, if the new moon was sighted in the first town, there would be a distinct possibility of sighting it in the second, barring any obstacles, such as clouds and high mountains .","Sistani"
"524",524,"

What is the rulings of His Eminence Grand Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Sistani (May Allah protect him) on sighting of the new moon crescent and determining the st day of the month?","Sighting of the new moon is ascertained by knowledge of the actual sighting or through solid news of such sighting, or some other means. Certainty can also be achieved through common knowledge. Amongst other sources of ascertaining the sighting of the new moon is the lapse of thirty days on Sha’ban’s crescent for the start of Ramadhan to be confirmed, or thirty days on the crescent of Ramadhan for the new moon of Shawwal to be confirmed [and so on]. Sighting can also be confirmed by the evidence of two witnesses of impeccable character (adl).
However, sighting of the new moon is not recognised by the evidence of women, or by the evidence of one just witness, even with oath, or by the words of astrologers. Neither by its absence after dawn dusk, so that it could be said that it belongs to a previous night, nor by the evidence of two just witnesses, if the evidence is not confined to their own sighting of the newly born moon. Sighting is not recognised too when it is seen before zawaal so that the day of sighting be from the ensuing month. The impression of a ring it may give, proving that it could belong to a previous night, cannot be accepted as well.","Sistani"

Does waqf  have a particular mechanism?","No, suppose a person built a place for public worship, not necessarily looking like a traditional mosque building, intending it to be a mosque, then it shall be deemed thus.","Sistani"

Is it permissible for the people of Ahlul Kitãb and other non-Muslims to enter the mosques (masjid) and other Islamic places of worship [like husayniyya or imambargah which are not masjid]? And is it necessarily for us to enforce the hijãb on those [non-Muslim women] who do not observe hijãb and allow them to enter [the mosque or places of worship], if it is permissible?","Based on obligatory precaution, it is not permissible for them [i.e., non-Muslims] to enter the mosque (masjid). As for their entering the places of worship, etc, there is no problem in it. If their entry [in imambargah or a husayniyya or a center] without hijãb is considered as a sign of disrespect, hijãb should be enforced on the [non-Muslim] women.","Sistani"

I am living in India and I have a lot of doubts about things I am using and I eating. What is my duty about such things?","A well known religious law says: ""Everything is ritually pure for you unless you come to know that it is ritually impure."" This law declares everything to be pure unless one becomes sure a particular item has become impure. And as long as you are not sure that it has become ritually impure (najis), it is to be considered pure and you can apply all the rules of purity to it without any hesitation or doubt.","Sistani"

What is the hokm (ruling) about Ahlul Kitab (people of the Book)? Are they clean? How should we deal with them?","The Ahlul Kitab (that is, the Jews, the Christians and the Zoroastrians) are ritually pure (tahir) as long as you do not know that they have become ritually impure (najis) by coming into contact with an impure object. You can follow this ruling when dealing with them.","Sistani"

Where does the domino effect of mutanajjis items stop when it is no longer wet?","The first mutanajjis item would make the item that comes into contact with it impure; similarly, the second mutanajjis would make the item that comes into contact with it impure; but the third mutanajjis can no longer make other items impure, irrespective of whether it is wet or dry.","Sistani"

Can Muslim, who rents a fully furnished house in the West, consider everything in it to be ritually pure as long as he does not find any trace of impure things in it, even if the previous occupant was from Ahlul Kitab, i.e., a Christian or a Jew? What if the previous occupant was a Buddhist or an atheist who does not believe in God and the prophets?","Yes, he can consider everything in the house ritually pure as long as he does not know that it has become impure. Just conjecture or doubt about impurity is of no value.","Sistani"

The floor of most houses in the West is covered with carpet which is glued to the floor in such a way that it is difficult to lift it off. How can such a carpet be rendered pure (tahir), if it becomes impure with urine or blood? The water used to purify in both the cases could be qalil or kathir. Please explain the ruling in both cases.","If it is possible to wipe the water off the carpet by using a piece of cloth or a vacuum cleaner, it can be purified with qalil water, provided that the water is wiped off the carpet, in the process. Conversely, it must be purified by kathir water [i.e., by using a hose pipe connected to the tap].","Sistani"

In the West, there are many public laundry places in which Muslims and non-Muslims wash their clothes. Is it permissible for us to pray in the clothes washed in such facilities, especially when we have no knowledge whether or not the washing machines are connected to the kurr water at some stages of the washing, and whether or not it purifies the clothes in the process of washing?","There is no problem in praying in those clothes that were pure before washing them [in such facilities] as long as you are not aware that they have become impure. [In other words, what goes in the public washing machine as pure comes out as pure unless you are sure that it has become impure.]
Similarly, [you can pray in] the impure clothes [that were washed in the public laundry machines] provided that you are reassured:
that the impure element, if any, has been washed away;
that the pure water covered the entire impure area twice (if it had become impure by urine and even if the water was connected to kurr source as an obligatory precaution) or just once (if it had become impure by other elements);
and that the water was removed from the clothes by wringing or other similar method [i.e., spinning of the machine] if it was qalil.
However, if you are not sure and just have conjecture that the garment has been purified as per religious requirement, the previously impure garment will still be considered impure and praying in it would not be valid.","Sistani"

A person used to make mistakes in the way he performed his wudhu (minor ablution) or ghusl (major ablution). After many years, he comes to realize his mistakes. When he inquires as how to solve his problem, he is told: ""Repeat all your prayers and perform the pilgrimage again."" Since saying all the prayers and doing the pilgrimage again is difficult, is there a solution which would salvage his prayers and pilgrimage performed with wudhu and ghusl that he thought was correct? Is there such a solution as a concession to this person so that he does not become disheartened and rebellions against religious obligations in a society which encourages such kind of rebellion?","If he was ignorant out of innocence, and therefore made mistakes without causing harm (e.g., did not follow the proper sequence in washing the head and the other parts of the body in ghusl; or did the wiping of the head or feet [mash] with a new water), then his wudhu and ghusl will be considered correct; and, consequently, his past prayers and pilgrimage will also be considered correct.
But if he was ignorant out of negligence in learning the Islamic laws or did mistakes which do invalidate the act in general (e.g., leaving out some parts of the body which must be washed in wudhu or ghusl), there is no way to validate his past prayers and pilgrimage.
However, if there is the fear that he would totally rebel when asked to make up all the past prayers and pilgrimage, then it is not appropriate to ask him to do so. Maybe Allah will improve his situation in future.","Sistani"

Some people pray for years and even perform pilgrimage, yet they do not pay khums. Is it obligatory on them to repeat their prayers and pilgrimage?","Based on precaution, it is obligatory on them to repeat prayers and pilgrimage, if the particular dress that they used in prayers, in tawaf and in salat of tawaf was from items on which khums had become due.
However, if only the dress they used in salat of tawaf was from items on which khums had become due, and they were ignorant (even out of negligence) of the law or the status of the dress, their pilgrimage is valid, but they have to repeat salat of tawaf if they had no excuse for their ignorance. [In this case,] they have, as a matter of precaution to return to Mecca [to perform the salat of tawaf again], if it does not entail great difficulty; otherwise they can perform that salat wherever they are.
Similarly, they will have to do the pilgrimage again if the animal offered as a sacrifice was bought with money on which khums had become due. However, if they had bought it with money whose unspecific portion was liable for khums -as is the case normally - there is no problem in their pilgrimage, even if they used it from the money on which khums had become liable; of course, they will be responsible for that amount [for payment of khums].
All this is applicable, if they knew about the obligation of khums and the law forbidding them to utilize items on which khums has become wajib or if they were ignorant out of negligence. But, if they were ignorant out of innocence, their prayers and pilgrimage are valid.","Sistani"

If a traveller leaves his home town immediately after the adhan of noon prayer, i.e. without saying that prayer, and reaches his destination after sunset, has he committed a sin?

Is the ink that had dried [on our hands, for example] a barrier to perform wudhu or ghusl?","If it does not form a mass that would prevent water from reaching the skin, the wudhu and ghusl is valid. However, if one has doubt whether it forms a mass or not, it must be removed.","Sistani"

Is it permissible for a Muslim to involve in pleasure by continuing to watch an entertaining movie even, though salat time is due, and then he goes to say his prayers just before it becomes overdue (qadha)?","It is not appropriate for a Muslim to delay the saying of salat from its preferred time (i.e., at the beginning of its time span) except for an excuse; what has been mentioned in the question is not an acceptable excuse.","Sistani"

Some women let their nails grow longer than necessary for beauty. Sometimes a nail breaks up, requiring a cover that must be placed over the broken nail. Knowing that such a cover prevents water from reaching the nail in wudhu and ghusl, is it permissible to use it? How should wudhu and ghusl be performed with that cover?","Wudhu and ghusl with such a cover over the nail is not valid; therefore, it is necessary to remove it for ablutions.

Eleven weeks ago I gave birth to a baby girl.

I would like to have more information regarding the depth and extent of a husband's obligations for maintenance and expenses of the wife.

What are the conditions for validity of an oath?","The conditions for validity of an oath are:
   1. A person who takes an oath should be Baligh and sane, and should do so with free will and clear intention. Hence, an oath by a minor, an insane person, an intoxicated person, or by a person who has been coerced to take an oath, will not be in order. Similarly, if he takes an oath involuntarily, or unintentionally, in a state of excitement, the oath will be void.
   2. An oath taken for the performance of an act which is haraam or makrooh, is not valid. Similarly, an oath for renouncing an act which is obligatory or Mustahab is also void. And if he takes an oath to perform a normal or usual act, it will be valid, if that act has any preference in the estimation of sensible people.
      Similarly, if he takes an oath for renouncing a usually permissible act, it will be valid if it is deemed more preferable than its performance, by the sensible people. In fact, in each case, his own judgement about the preferences will be enough to grant validity to the oath, even if other sensible people may not concur.
   3. The oath must be sworn by one of those names of the Almighty Allah which are exclusively used for Him, (e.g. 'Allah'). And even if he swears by a name which is used for other beings also, but is used so extensively for Him, that when any person utters that name one is reminded of Him Alone, for example, if he swears by the name Khaliq (the Creator) and Raziq (the Bestower), the oath will be in order.
      In fact, if he uses other names or attributes of Allah, which do not remind of Him, but give that connotation when used during an oath, like Samee' (All Hearing) or Baseer (All Seeing), even then the oath will be valid.
   4. The oath should be uttered in words, but a dumb person can take an oath by making a sign. Similarly, if a person is unable to utter the words, he may write down the oath, repeating in his mind the intention for it, that will be a valid oath, though as a precaution, he may confirm the oath in other ways as well.
   5. It should be possible for him to act upon his oath. And if he was able to act upon the oath when he took it, but became incapable of acting upon it later, the oath becomes nullified from the time he became incapable of acting upon it, provided that he did not incapacitate himself purposely. And the same rule applies if acting upon one's vow, oath, or covenant, involves unbearable hardship.","Sistani"
"575",575,"

If a person breaks his oath, what is he supposed to do?","If a person takes an oath that he will perform an act (e.g. that he will fast) or will refrain from doing an act (e.g. that he will not smoke), but does not intentionally act according to his oath, he should give Kaffarah for it, which means he should set a slave free, or should fully feed ten indigent persons, or should provide them with clothes.

If I pray with a leather belt or a wallet made from leather of a mayta and realize it during the salat or after finishing it but before the end of its time span or after the ending of its time span-what would become of that prayer?","The prayer with a wallet made from leather of a mayta is valid just as it is acceptable to pray with a belt made from such a leather, provided that the probability of it being from zabiha is not a very low probability that would be ignored by sensible people.
In the second case [of very low probability], if he was ignorant [of this rule] and realized during salat, he should take it off immediately and his salat would be valid. The same rule would apply if he forgot [that he had the wallet or the belt on him] and remembered during salat, provided that his forgetfulness was not a result of carelessness and indifference. In other cases, he will have to repeat salat in time or qadha as a matter of obligatory precaution.","Sistani"

It happens that the time of salat sets in while the Muslim worker is at his work-place, - noting that finding work is not easy - thus, he finds it difficult to leave the work for salat. Sometimes he ends up losing his job because of his insistence on saying salat. Is he allowed to say his prayers as qadha? Or must he say them [on time], even if it leads to him losing his job?","If the need to work at that place reaches the level of necessity, then he should pray in time in whatever way possible: even just by indicating [by lowering the neck halfway for ruku' and fully for sajda]. However, such a situation would arise only exceptionally. So he should fear Almighty Allah and not accept a job which leads to neglecting the pillar of faith; thus, he should remember the words of the Almighty: ""And whosoever fears Allah, He will make a way out for him [from difficulties] and provide for him from where he does not expect.""

If the time for salat has come while the student is still on his way to the university. When he reaches the university, he realizes that the time of salat has ended. In this case, is it permissible for him to say salat in the car although there are places in which he could pray, yet by going to those places he may risk becoming late [for his university]?","The delay in getting to the work place [or university] is not a good enough reason for praying in the car. This is because it involves non fulfillment of some of its conditions while it is possible to get down and pray normally on the earth with all the conditions fulfilled.

How can we say our obligatory prayers in an aircraft, especially if we do not know the direction of the qiblah taking into consideration the instability of the floor [because the plane is in motion]?","As for the qiblah, it is possible to identify its direction by asking the captain or the airhostesses because their answers usually carry validity and are a source of assurance. One should therefore act accordingly.
As for the stability of the floor where salat is to be performed, that condition will be waived when it is not possible to achieve it.

But if he intends to stay in that city for a short while only and is considered, in the general sense, as a visitor, he should pray qasr.","Sistani"

What is your ruling about cat hair on a person's dress during salat?","If there is one cat hair or there are two or three hairs on a person's body or clothes, his prayer is in order but if there are more than that, his prayer becomes void, as an obligatory precaution.

Some people pray for years and even perform pilgrimage, yet they do not pay khums. Is it obligatory on them to repeat their prayers and pilgrimage?","Based on precaution, it is obligatory on them to repeat prayers and pilgrimage, if the particular dress that they used in prayers, in tawaf and in salat of tawaf was from items on which khums had become due.
However, if only the dress they used in salat of tawaf was from items on which khums had become due, and they were ignorant (even out of negligence) of the law or the status of the dress, their pilgrimage is valid, but they have to repeat salat of tawaf if they had no excuse for their ignorance. [In this case,] they have, as a matter of precaution to return to Mecca [to perform the salat of tawaf again], if it does not entail great difficulty; otherwise they can perform that salat wherever they are.
Similarly, they will have to do the pilgrimage again if the animal offered as a sacrifice was bought with money on which khums had become due. However, if they had bought it with money whose unspecific portion was liable for khums -as is the case normally - there is no problem in their pilgrimage, even if they used it from the money on which khums had become liable; of course, they will be responsible for that amount [for payment of khums].
All this is applicable, if they knew about the obligation of khums and the law forbidding them to utilize items on which khums has become wajib or if they were ignorant out of negligence. But, if they were ignorant out of innocence, their prayers and pilgrimage are valid.","Sistani"

A person used to make mistakes in the way he performed his wudhu (minor ablution) or ghusl (major ablution). After many years, he comes to realize his mistakes. When he inquires as how to solve his problem, he is told: ""Repeat all your prayers and perform the pilgrimage again."" Since saying all the prayers and doing the pilgrimage again is difficult, is there a solution which would salvage his prayers and pilgrimage performed with wudhu and ghusl that he thought was correct? Is there such a solution as a concession to this person so that he does not become disheartened and rebellions against religious obligations in a society which encourages such kind of rebellion?","If he was ignorant out of innocence, and therefore made mistakes without causing harm (e.g., did not follow the proper sequence in washing the head and the other parts of the body in ghusl; or did the wiping of the head or feet [mash] with a new water), then his wudhu and ghusl will be considered correct; and, consequently, his past prayers and pilgrimage will also be considered correct.
But if he was ignorant out of negligence in learning the Islamic laws or did mistakes which do invalidate the act in general (e.g., leaving out some parts of the body which must be washed in wudhu or ghusl), there is no way to validate his past prayers and pilgrimage.
However, if there is the fear that he would totally rebel when asked to make up all the past prayers and pilgrimage, then it is not appropriate to ask him to do so. Maybe Allah will improve his situation in future.","Sistani"

What about the leather products made in a European country, if we are unaware of the source of that leather? It is said that some European countries import cheap leather from Muslim countries and then use it for manufacturing various products. Can we consider such leather pure? Are we allowed to say salat in them? Can such a weak probability [about it originating from a Muslim country] be given any credence?","If the probability of the leather originating from a zabiha (an animal slaughtered Islamically) source is so weak that people would not normally give any credence (for example, the probability of 2%), it is to be considered impure and this cannot be used in salat. But if the probability is not so weak, it can be considered pure and using it in salat would be permissible.","Sistani"

In the West, there are many public laundry places in which Muslims and non-Muslims wash their clothes. Is it permissible for us to pray in the clothes washed in such facilities, especially when we have no knowledge whether or not the washing machines are connected to the kurr water at some stages of the washing, and whether or not it purifies the clothes in the process of washing?","There is no problem in praying in those clothes that were pure before washing them [in such facilities] as long as you are not aware that they have become impure. [In other words, what goes in the public washing machine as pure comes out as pure unless you are sure that it has become impure.]
Similarly, [you can pray in] the impure clothes [that were washed in the public laundry machines] provided that you are reassured:
that the impure element, if any, has been washed away;
that the pure water covered the entire impure area twice (if it had become impure by urine and even if the water was connected to kurr source as an obligatory precaution) or just once (if it had become impure by other elements);
and that the water was removed from the clothes by wringing or other similar method [i.e., spinning of the machine] if it was qalil.
However, if you are not sure and just have conjecture that the garment has been purified as per religious requirement, the previously impure garment will still be considered impure and praying in it would not be valid.","Sistani"

Please explain the ruling in both cases.","If it is possible to wipe the water off the carpet by using a piece of cloth or a vacuum cleaner, it can be purified with qalil water, provided that the water is wiped off the carpet, in the process.

How should we say our salat in trains and cars? Is it necessary to do prostration (sajda) on something or is it not necessary, in that would bending of the neck be sufficient?","It is obligatory to say salat in the usual way where possible. So, one should face the qiblah in all stages of the salat; if not, at least while saying the opening takbir. Otherwise the condition of facing the qiblah will be dropped. Similarly, if it is possible to do the bowing (ruku') and prostration (sajdah) normally (e.g., in the aisle of the bus or the train), those parts of salat should be done normally. But if it is not possible, then one should try to bow normally for ruku' and sajdah [for example, from a sitting position on the seat or the berth of the train].
For sajdah, one has to put the forehead on an item on which sajdah is valid, even if by lifting that item to the forehead. If bowing normally is not possible, one should just indicate by bending the neck [halfway for ruku and fully for sajdah].","Sistani"

What are the conditions for validity of an oath?","The conditions for validity of an oath are:
   1. A person who takes an oath should be Baligh and sane, and should do so with free will and clear intention. Hence, an oath by a minor, an insane person, an intoxicated person, or by a person who has been coerced to take an oath, will not be in order. Similarly, if he takes an oath involuntarily, or unintentionally, in a state of excitement, the oath will be void.
   2. An oath taken for the performance of an act which is haraam or makrooh, is not valid. Similarly, an oath for renouncing an act which is obligatory or Mustahab is also void. And if he takes an oath to perform a normal or usual act, it will be valid, if that act has any preference in the estimation of sensible people.
      Similarly, if he takes an oath for renouncing a usually permissible act, it will be valid if it is deemed more preferable than its performance, by the sensible people. In fact, in each case, his own judgement about the preferences will be enough to grant validity to the oath, even if other sensible people may not concur.
   3. The oath must be sworn by one of those names of the Almighty Allah which are exclusively used for Him, (e.g. 'Allah'). And even if he swears by a name which is used for other beings also, but is used so extensively for Him, that when any person utters that name one is reminded of Him Alone, for example, if he swears by the name Khaliq (the Creator) and Raziq (the Bestower), the oath will be in order.
      In fact, if he uses other names or attributes of Allah, which do not remind of Him, but give that connotation when used during an oath, like Samee' (All Hearing) or Baseer (All Seeing), even then the oath will be valid.
   4. The oath should be uttered in words, but a dumb person can take an oath by making a sign. Similarly, if a person is unable to utter the words, he may write down the oath, repeating in his mind the intention for it, that will be a valid oath, though as a precaution, he may confirm the oath in other ways as well.
   5. It should be possible for him to act upon his oath. And if he was able to act upon the oath when he took it, but became incapable of acting upon it later, the oath becomes nullified from the time he became incapable of acting upon it, provided that he did not incapacitate himself purposely. And the same rule applies if acting upon one's vow, oath, or covenant, involves unbearable hardship.","Sistani"

If a person breaks his oath, what does he need to do in order to make it up?","If a person takes an oath that he will perform an act (e.g. that he will fast) or will refrain from doing an act (e.g. that he will not smoke), but does not intentionally act according to his oath, he should give Kaffarah for it, which means he should set a slave free, or should fully feed ten indigent persons, or should provide them with clothes. And if he is not able to perform these acts, he should fast for three consecutive days.","Sistani"

How should we say our salat in trains and cars? Is it necessary to do prostration (sajda) on something or is it not necessary, in that would bending of the neck be sufficient?","It is obligatory to say salat in the usual way where possible. So, one should face the qiblah in all stages of the salat; if not, at least while saying the opening takbir. Otherwise the condition of facing the qiblah will be dropped. Similarly, if it is possible to do the bowing (ruku') and prostration (sajdah) normally (e.g., in the aisle of the bus or the train), those parts of salat should be done normally. But if it is not possible, then one should try to bow normally for ruku' and sajdah [for example, from a sitting position on the seat or the berth of the train].
For sajdah, one has to put the forehead on an item on which sajdah is valid, even if by lifting that item to the forehead. If bowing normally is not possible, one should just indicate by bending the neck [halfway for ruku and fully for sajdah].","Sistani"
"657",657,"

How can we say our obligatory prayers in an aircraft, especially if we do not know the direction of the qiblah taking into consideration the instability of the floor [because the plane is in motion]?","As for the qiblah, it is possible to identify its direction by asking the captain or the airhostesses because their answers usually carry validity and are a source of assurance. One should therefore act accordingly.
As for the stability of the floor where salat is to be performed, that condition will be waived when it is not possible to achieve it. However, other conditions of prayers should, wherever possible, be observed. Under no circumstance should the prayer be delayed beyond its appropriate time span.","Sistani"
"658",658,"

What are the conditions for slaughtering of an animal?","There are certain conditions for the slaughtering of an animal. They are as follows:-
   1. A person, a man or a woman, who slaughters an animal must be a Muslim. An animal can also be slaughtered by a Muslim child who is mature enough to distinguish between good and bad, but not by non-Muslims other than Ahle Kitab, or a person belonging to those sects who are classified as Kafir, like, Nawasib - the enemies of Ahlul Bait (A.S.). In fact, even if Ahle Kitab non-Muslim slaughters an animal, as per precaution, it will not be halal, even if he utters 'Bismillah'.
   2. The animal should be slaughtered with a weapon made of iron. However, if an implement made of iron is not available, it should be slaughtered with a sharp object like glass or stone, so that the four veins are severed, even if the slaughtering may not be necessary, like when the animal is on the verge of death.
   3. When an animal is slaughtered, it should be facing Qibla. If the animal is sitting or standing, then facing Qibla would be like a man standing towards Qibla while praying. And if it is lying on its right or left side, then its neck and stomach should be facing Qibla. It is not necessary that its legs, hands and face be towards Qibla.
      If a person who knows the rule, purposely ignores placing the animal towards Qibla, the animal would become haraam; but if he forgets or does not know the rule, or makes a mistake in ascertaining the Qibla, or does not know the direction of Qibla, or is unable to turn the animal towards Qibla, there is no objection. As a recommended precaution, the person slaughtering should also face Qibla.
   4. When a person wants to slaughter an animal, just as he makes the Niyyat to slaughter, he should utter the name of Allah, and it suffices if he says 'Bismillah' only, or if he utters 'Allah'. But if he utters the name of Allah without the intention of slaughtering the animal, the slaughtered animal does not become Pak and it is also haraam to eat its meat. And if he did not utter the name of Allah forgetfully, there is no objection.
   5. The animal should show some movement after being slaughtered; at least it should move its eyes or tail or strike its foot on the ground.This law applies only when it is doubtful whether or not the animal was alive at the time of being slaughtered, otherwise it is not essential.
   6. It is necessary that the blood should flow in normal quantity from the slaughtered animal. If someone blocks the vein, not allowing blood to flow out, or if the bleeding is less than normal, that animal will not be halal. But if the blood which flows is less because the animal bled profusely before the slaughter, there is no objection.
   7. The animal should be slaughtered from its proper place of slaughtering; on the basis of recommended precaution, the neck should be cut from its front, and the knife should be used from the back of the neck.","Sistani"
"659",659,"

What is the ruling in the matter of the meat or hide of an animal sold by Muslims, especially, when it is not known it was ritually slaughtered?","You should assume that it was ceremonially slaughtered, unless you have proof to the contrary.","Sistani"
"660",660,"

Would prevention by law, of slaughtering at Mina be sufficient to realise the inability to carry out slaughtering there, especially, if there was reason to believe that a financial or physical harm could ensue, should the law be broken?","Fear of consequential harm for breaking the law should lift the obligation of slaughtering at Mina. It must not be understood, though, that slaughtering elsewhere would make up for slaughtering in it. However, what makes slaughtering elsewhere in order is [indeed] Mina’s small capacity to host all pilgrims as discussed in Manisikul Hajj. Apparently, slaughtering was made impossible, for the reasons mentioned in the question, not for the smallness of Mina? Therefor, combining both slaughtering outside Mina and fasting in lieu of hady (sacrificial offering) should be in order, as a matter of ihtiyat luzumi.","Sistani"
"661",661,"

Nowadays, it is not feasible to divide hady into three shares. Even the authorities prevent the owner of hady to eat from it. Similarly, they prevent distributing hady on the poor and the believers. What should one do?","What is obligatory, that must not be fluted for reasons of ihtiyat, out of the said division is giving the third [of hady] to the poor. As for eating of one’s own share and giving some of it out for present to others, they are not obligatory. Giving the third party by way of sadaqah can cease to be operative, should it become impossible or difficult.","Sistani"
"664",664,"

What is the duty of a Hajj pilgrim in the present circumstance in which the old distance between Safa and Marwah is closed and reconstructed whereas an alternate route has been opened for pilgrims to perform their Umrah? Is the Umra valid?","The reply is in different forms:
 N* 1- The pilgrim knows that Safa & Marwa mounts do not continue up to the new Masa'a (place for Sai'ee). In this case, to be able to come out from the state of Ihram, the pilgrim should slaughter an animal (Kurbani) in Mecca -in terms of obligatory precaution, that animal should have the same conditions as the sacrifice in Mina- and distribute it among the poor and then cut his hair (Takseer) or shave his head (Halq). This applies to the one who was not aware of this current situation before being clothed in Ihram. Otherwise, if he had known this problem beforehand, according to obligatory precaution, he cannot come out from Ihram and should stay there until the accomplishment of the Sai'ee become possible for him. He may refer in this case to another Marja considering the most knowledgeable (Aalam fal Aalam)
 N* 2- The pilgrim is sure that the mounts continue up to the new  
Masa'a or this is proven by the Fatwa of some other Maraje that  
trustees had witnessed and this witness is not contradicting the view of other trustees. In such case, it is allowed to do the Sai'ee in the new place.
   N* 3- If none of the above situations are proven for him, he should do both: Sai'ee in the new way and also slaughtering an animal with the same conditions mentioned above, and then do Halq or Taqseer.
 Note:
 For those who have already done their Umra with the Sai'ee in the new way should now sacrifice the animal and then do Halq or Taqseer, even if they have already come back to their countries, as they are still considered as Muhrim (being in the state of Ihram).","Sistani"

Is it permissible for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman who is still married to a non-Muslim man? Is there an ‘idda period for her when she separates from her non-Muslim husband? What is the period of that ‘idda? Is it permissible to have sexual relations with her during the time when she is in the ‘idda from her non-Muslim husband? If she embraces Islam, how long will her ‘idda be,  if she intends to marry a Muslim man?","It is not permissible to marry her while she is married to a non-Muslim in a marriage which is recognized by them because she is a married woman. It is permissible to marry her temporarily after her divorce and after the completion of the ‘idda from her non-Muslim husband. (The period of her ‘idda is not different from the ‘idda of a Muslim woman.) Therefore, it is not permissible before the completion of the ‘idda.
If she becomes a Muslim after having had sexual relations with her non-Muslim husband and the husband has not embraced Islam, it is precuationarily obligatory for a Muslim not to marry her until after the completion of her ‘idda. But if she became a Muslim without having ever established sexual relations with her non-Muslim husband, then their marriage will be annulled immediately and there is no ‘idda in such a case.","Sistani"

Is it obligatory to inform the man who wants to marry a woman from the Ahlul Kitab or a Muslim woman that she has not yet observed the waiting period (‘idda) of a divorce of a previous marriage, or that she is still in the ‘idda [during which marriage is forbidden for her]?","It is not obligatory.","Sistani"

A Muslim man who is married to a Muslim woman migrated from his country. After a longthy stay in the West country, he wants to embark on temporary marriage with a woman from Ahlul Kitab just a few days after divorcing his Muslim wife. Is this permissible for him, espeually when his Muslim wife is still in her waiting period (al-‘idda)?","The temporary marriage mentioned in the question is considered invalid because the wife who is in the waiting period of a revocable divorce is still considered as a wife. It has just been mentioned that to temporary marry an Ahlul Kitab woman while one has a Muslim wife is not permissible [as a matter of compulsary precaution].","Sistani"

A Muslim couple got separated for a long time. Is it permissible for him to marry, temporarily or permanently, a woman from Ahlul Kitab without the knowledge of his Muslim wife? Is it permissible for him to marry, with the permission of  his Muslim wife?","For a Muslim man to marry a woman from Ahlul Kitab permanently is against the compulsory precaution in any circumstance. And his temporary marriage to a Jewish or a Christian woman is allowed, only if he is not already married to a Muslim wife. If he has a Muslim wife, temporary marriage with an Ahlul Kitab woman is not permissible without her consent; nay, even with her consent, it is not permissible, based on compulsory precaution.","Sistani"

If a woman is over thirty years of age, and still virgin, is it necessary for her to seek the permission of her guardian for marriage?","If she is not independent, it is obligatory on her to seek his consent.

A two-level bridge has been built recently around the Holy Ka'abah. Is it permissible for an able-bodied or a disabled pilgrim to perform tawaf on those bridges, of free choice or out of necessity? What is the Islamic law about offering tawaf prayer there?","As for the first level of the bridge, performing tawaf on it would be valid even in the state of free choice. Of course, when it comes to obligatory tawaf, one must, as a measure of necessary precaution, observe the regular succession (muwalat) between performing the tawaf and its prayer. If it is possible to offer the tawaf prayer on the bridge itself beyond and close to the maqam (station of Ibrahim), there is no problem.
As for the second and upper level of the bridge, if the duty-bound (pilgrim) finds that the bridge is situated lower than the wall of the Ka'abah even to the extent of one span, it is permissible to perform tawaf on it as well. In case, however, it is not possible for the pilgrim to observe regular succession between the obligatory tawaf and its prayer (since it takes long to go down to the courtyard of the Mosque – not ten minutes or less), the tawaf would not be correct on his part, as a necessary precaution. This ruling applies to the able-bodied who may choose to perform tawaf on the upper level of the circular bridge. As for the sick and disabled who use wheelchairs and are not allowed to perform tawaf except on the upper level, it is permissible for them to perform tawaf on the bridge and the tawaf will not be affected, even if the pilgrim fails, owing to being compelled, to observe succession between the tawaf and its prayer. 
If the duty-bound has not made sure about the upper level being lower than the wall of the Holy Ka'abah, even to the extent of a span, the tawaf would not be in order. If he is a disabled pilgrim who is using a wheelchair and is not allowed to perform tawaf anywhere other than the upper level of the bridge, he should combine between tawaf from there and choosing a representative who would perform tawaf on the courtyard of the Grand Mosque or on the lower floor and he himself should offer the tawaf prayer.

Some women let their nails grow longer than necessary for beauty. Sometimes a nail breaks up, requiring a cover that must be placed over the broken nail. Knowing that such a cover prevents water from reaching the nail in wudhu and ghusl, is it permissible to use it? How should wudhu and ghusl be performed with that cover?","Wudhu and ghusl with such a cover over the nail is not valid; therefore, it is necessary to remove it for ablutions. And the purpose mentioned above for the cover is not justifiable.","Sistani"
"682",682,"

Is cream a barrier to water reaching the skin, and if so should it be removed prior to wudhu and ghusl?","Apparently the effect left on the skin after it is applied is nothing but just moisture, and so it does not constitute a barrier to water reaching the skin .","Sistani"
"683",683,"

Is the ink that had dried [on our hands, for example] a barrier to perform wudhu or ghusl?","If it does not form a mass that would prevent water from reaching the skin, the wudhu and ghusl is valid. However, if one has doubt whether it forms a mass or not, it must be removed.","Sistani"

A person used to make mistakes in the way he performed his wudhu (minor ablution) or ghusl (major ablution). After many years, he comes to realize his mistakes. When he inquires as how to solve his problem, he is told: ""Repeat all your prayers and perform the pilgrimage again."" Since saying all the prayers and doing the pilgrimage again is difficult, is there a solution which would salvage his prayers and pilgrimage performed with wudhu and ghusl that he thought was correct? Is there such a solution as a concession to this person so that he does not become disheartened and rebellions against religious obligations in a society which encourages such kind of rebellion?","If he was ignorant out of innocence, and therefore made mistakes without causing harm (e.g., did not follow the proper sequence in washing the head and the other parts of the body in ghusl; or did the wiping of the head or feet [mash] with a new water), then his wudhu and ghusl will be considered correct; and, consequently, his past prayers and pilgrimage will also be considered correct.
But if he was ignorant out of negligence in learning the Islamic laws or did mistakes which do invalidate the act in general (e.g., leaving out some parts of the body which must be washed in wudhu or ghusl), there is no way to validate his past prayers and pilgrimage.
However, if there is the fear that he would totally rebel when asked to make up all the past prayers and pilgrimage, then it is not appropriate to ask him to do so. Maybe Allah will improve his situation in future.","Sistani"

If a Hashimi receives Zakat of property or fitra from a non-Hashimi, it would be forbidden for him to use it, and he who gives it (zakat), his ""Zimma"" (obligation) would not be discharged. In cases other than those mentioned above it is permissible for a non-Hashimi to give his Sadaqa, atonement, or Fidya of fast ( kaffara) or any desirable charity to a Hashimi.

									   Is it permissible for non-Shias to make use of your edicts without becoming Shia Muslims?
								","
									   Our edicts are based on the teachings of the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) through the narrations that reached us in reliable ways, which all Muslims are required to act upon. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) ordered the nation of Islam to refer to the Ahlulbait and follow them in the famous well-known narration that is reported by numerous ways in the books of Shias and Sunnis  ""I leave among you the two weighty things  the Book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you follow both of them, you will never be misguided.""

								","
									   When a person starts emulating a marja after he realizes his responsibility in observing the rulings of the Sharia, he refers to the basic logic that every sane person will arrive at, and upon which one will be responsible to act in accordance to. There is no doubt that this logic obligates the ignorant to refer to the knowledgeable in what the latter knows. As the knowledgeable in the religious sciences (i.e. the mujtahids) differ in their views in various religious rulings, including their view in following the most knowledgeable, it becomes necessary to follow the edicts of one of them based on a distinguished characteristic that others do not possess, which is being the most knowledgeable. Although the views of some of the mujtahids do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, but in order to assure that we fulfil our responsibility of observing the Sharia with certainty, the initial logical ruling leads to following the edicts of the most knowledgeable in the issue of referring to the most knowledgeable mujtahid. This is so because the view of mujtahids who do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable allow following the most knowledgeable. To the contrary, the views of those who necessitate following the most knowledgeable do not allow following any mujtahid other than the most knowledgeable. In other words, following the most knowledgeable is obligatory according to some and permissible according to others, whereas not following the most knowledgeable is permissible according to some and prohibited according to others. It is natural then to follow the most knowledgeable in this issue. If his view – in this issue – necessitates following the most knowledgeable, one should follow him in the rest of his views. If his view does not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, then one can follow another mujtahid.

									   When I go to study in the Islamic seminary of Najaf, what do I have to study to become a mujtahid?
								","
									   A believer should aim to fulfill the religious responsibilities of upholding the orders of the Sharia; one of them is learning the Islamic laws and teaching them. This could be achieved by learning more about the religion – and not necessarily reaching the level of ijtihad – by which a believer could serve Islam. One could serve the religion and be a role model amongst his society, family and friends by being obedient to the Islamic laws and by spreading the religious teachings in the areas where he resides. Therefore, ijtihad is not a goal that a student should have from the beginning. Ijtihad is a talent that can be achieved by studying and with the guidance of Almighty Allah. A student of Islamic studies should study hard and make use of his time as much as possible. If he achieves this, then he can thank Almighty Allah for this bounty. If he does not, he can still serve the religion.

It is not because the concept is new. Rather, it was present at the time of the Imams (peace be upon them) when they were directing their companions and followers, in general, to learn the religious laws. This naturally led to many people asking questions about their affairs, and it was not practical for all of them to reach the Imam (peace be upon him) and ask him in person, so they used to refer to his close companions who could be reached to gain knowledge in religious laws. There were known narrators who were giving edicts to people and the Shias used to refer to them during those days, like Muhammad bin Muslim, Zurarah, Zakariyya bin Adam and others. This need continued to exist after the occultation of the Twelfth Imam (peace be upon him) until now.

								","
									   When a person starts emulating a marja after he realizes his responsibility in observing the rulings of the Sharia, he refers to the basic logic that every sane person will arrive at, and upon which one will be responsible to act in accordance to. There is no doubt that this logic obligates the ignorant to refer to the knowledgeable in what the latter knows. As the knowledgeable in the religious sciences (i.e. the mujtahids) differ in their views in various religious rulings, including their view in following the most knowledgeable, it becomes necessary to follow the edicts of one of them based on a distinguished characteristic that others do not possess, which is being the most knowledgeable. Although the views of some of the mujtahids do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, but in order to assure that we fulfil our responsibility of observing the Sharia with certainty, the initial logical ruling leads to following the edicts of the most knowledgeable in the issue of referring to the most knowledgeable mujtahid. This is so because the view of mujtahids who do not necessitate following the most knowledgeable allow following the most knowledgeable. To the contrary, the views of those who necessitate following the most knowledgeable do not allow following any mujtahid other than the most knowledgeable. In other words, following the most knowledgeable is obligatory according to some and permissible according to others, whereas not following the most knowledgeable is permissible according to some and prohibited according to others. It is natural then to follow the most knowledgeable in this issue. If his view – in this issue – necessitates following the most knowledgeable, one should follow him in the rest of his views. If his view does not necessitate following the most knowledgeable, then one can follow another mujtahid.

									   The ahl-ul-khibrah are those who can recognize the most knowledgeable by his writings, research and edicts. Those experts can be reached through communicating with the Howza. If such communication is not possible or determining the most knowledgeable is not possible, one is required to choose one of the scholars who have reached the level of ijtihad and fulfil the conditions of being a marja, and follow him. The chosen should be the most God-fearing amongst them if possible. Otherwise, the believer can choose one of them and follow his verdicts.

								","
									   The emulation that Shias do is not blind taqleed. It is, rather, based on vision and wisdom, since everybody is asked to observe the Sharia and act upon its obligations and refrain from what it prohibits; and at the same time, a normal Muslim does not possess the specialized capabilities to know the laws of the religion. It becomes natural for those who are not experts in this field to refer to the jurist who specializes in deriving the rulings of the Sharia after exerting great efforts in order to reach religious conclusions. Taql<U+012B>d is commonly practiced by people all the time, when they refer – in the aspects that require expert knowledge and scientific efforts – to those who specialize in the specific fields, like medical doctors and engineers, and they act upon their findings and conclusions. Moreover, the Holy Quran and the Sunnah hold a central position in the process of derivation of the mujtahid, so naturally the rulings of a mujtahid – who fulfills the conditions of being a marja' – will not be against them. Therefore, bearing all this mind, it is not within the non-expert Muslim's domain to judge a mujtahid's edicts, otherwise his judgment will be without any base.

									   The individual – who has not reached the level of ijtihad, nor does he act on precaution between the edicts of the mujtahids – cannot guarantee the correctness of his deeds before Almighty Allah, unless they correspond to the edicts of a religious scholar who is an expert in Islamic jurisprudence, i.e. a mujtahid. Referring to the expert will relieve him from liability if the edicts of the mujtahid do not conform to the actual legislated laws of Allah Almighty.

The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) ordered the nation of Islam to refer to the Ahlulbait and follow them in the famous well-known narration that is reported by numerous ways in the books of Shias and Sunnis  ""I leave among you the two weighty things  the Book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you follow both of them, you will never be misguided.""

									   When I go to study in the Islamic seminary of Najaf, what do I have to study to become a mujtahid?
								","
									   A believer should aim to fulfill the religious responsibilities of upholding the orders of the Sharia; one of them is learning the Islamic laws and teaching them. This could be achieved by learning more about the religion – and not necessarily reaching the level of ijtihad – by which a believer could serve Islam. One could serve the religion and be a role model amongst his society, family and friends by being obedient to the Islamic laws and by spreading the religious teachings in the areas where he resides. Therefore, ijtihad is not a goal that a student should have from the beginning. Ijtihad is a talent that can be achieved by studying and with the guidance of Almighty Allah. A student of Islamic studies should study hard and make use of his time as much as possible. If he achieves this, then he can thank Almighty Allah for this bounty. If he does not, he can still serve the religion.

								","
									   You should follow the scholar who has reached the level of ijtihad and fulfills all the other conditions of the marja in all issues.

The oppressors and the liars throughout the times have made obstacles for us in obtaining the truths from the Imams (peace be upon them) which made the mission of the mujtahids more difficult.

								","
									   Referring to the religious jurists in finding the rulings of the Sharia is one of concepts which have certain limitations and conditions, for which one must refer to the religious legislator, Almighty Allah. The religious texts explain the general qualities of the scholars whom one should refer to. This concept was implemented during the time of the Imams (peace be upon them) themselves, who guided the believers to refer to certain scholars amongst the disciples in various parts of the Muslim world. The followers of the Ahlulbait continued for the subsequent generations to refer to the scholars who fulfilled the criteria described by the Imams (peace be upon them). Since there are more than one scholar who fulfills these qualities, the individual should refer to the one who is most knowledgeable, and determining this is a subjective task for each individual. Therefore, the believers will naturally come to different conclusions and have different Marjas to follow.

									   The suggested way does not return the taharah of the place. Taharah is done with the use of water. After the removal of the najasah and if under-Kurr water is being used, the najis place should be washed twice, with the removal of the water after each time. This can be done by a piece of cloth or a mop or the like to soak it up. The collected water is najis so one should make sure that najasah does not spread because of it. A bucket or a large utensil can be used near the najis place to put the cloth with the najis collected water. If running water is used, it is enough to wash the place once with or after the removal of any traces of najasah. To be sure that the whole place is Tahir, all parts which are suspected to be najis must be made tahir.

									   If your hand comes in contact with the impure leather with dampness then it becomes najis even without the actual najasah being transferred to the hand.

									   I have noticed a great commotion in regards to moon sighting issues. The Maraji have various edicts on this, which has led to some confusion and doubts in regards to Marja’iyyah and the concept of Taqleed. To remedy this, is it possible for the Maraji to get together to reach one conclusion and one edict on this issue?
								","
									   What has happened in recent years is because of the differences in the ijtihad and in interpretations of the sources and narrations from the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Some religious authorities – including his Eminence Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) – have the opinion that the narrations from the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) prove that most countries can have one Eid in such a way that if the crescent was seen in a country, it is sufficient to establish Eid in other countries as well, even if the distance between the two countries is relatively far. The details of the verdict of his Eminence are explained in his books of Islamic Laws. However, some other Maraji have the opinion that seeing the crescent in a country will prove it to be the night of Eid for other countries only if they share a horizon, so such sighting does not necessarily prove the Eid in other distant countries. If the differences in the edicts originate from the differences in Ijtihad and understanding of religious texts, then it is unavoidable, since a Mujtahid cannot change his opinions that are based on his own Ijtihad and research simply because of social pressure or similar reasons that are not related to what the religious texts indicate as per his understanding. As a matter of fact, doing so is considered as compromising against his duties in finding religious realities. Differences of these types indicate the authenticity of the Shia sect, and the piety and sincerity of its followers. The Marja’ tries his best – via his research and teaching – to reach the religious realities. At the same time, the believers try their best to find out the most knowledgeable Mujtahid who fulfills all the criteria of the Marja’ and to act upon his edicts. This shows the strength of faith that these two groups possess. Difference in opinions should not lead to conflicts or aversion. It should rather be dealt with calmness and wisdom for the sake of unity and the general interests of the believers.

									   I have noticed a great commotion in regards to moon sighting issues. The Maraji have various edicts on this, which has led to some confusion and doubts in regards to Marja’iyyah and the concept of Taqleed. To remedy this, is it possible for the Maraji to get together to reach one conclusion and one edict on this issue?
								","
									   What has happened in recent years is because of the differences in the ijtihad and in interpretations of the sources and narrations from the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). Some religious authorities – including his Eminence Sayyid Al-Hakeem (may Allah prolong his life) – have the opinion that the narrations from the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) prove that most countries can have one Eid in such a way that if the crescent was seen in a country, it is sufficient to establish Eid in other countries as well, even if the distance between the two countries is relatively far. The details of the verdict of his Eminence are explained in his books of Islamic Laws. However, some other Maraji have the opinion that seeing the crescent in a country will prove it to be the night of Eid for other countries only if they share a horizon, so such sighting does not necessarily prove the Eid in other distant countries. If the differences in the edicts originate from the differences in Ijtihad and understanding of religious texts, then it is unavoidable, since a Mujtahid cannot change his opinions that are based on his own Ijtihad and research simply because of social pressure or similar reasons that are not related to what the religious texts indicate as per his understanding. As a matter of fact, doing so is considered as compromising against his duties in finding religious realities. Differences of these types indicate the authenticity of the Shia sect, and the piety and sincerity of its followers. The Marja’ tries his best – via his research and teaching – to reach the religious realities. At the same time, the believers try their best to find out the most knowledgeable Mujtahid who fulfills all the criteria of the Marja’ and to act upon his edicts. This shows the strength of faith that these two groups possess. Difference in opinions should not lead to conflicts or aversion. It should rather be dealt with calmness and wisdom for the sake of unity and the general interests of the believers.

(3) The four livestock  camels, cows, goats and sheep. Gold and silver coins are not used as tender nowadays, so the Zakat on this group does not apply. The Zakat on the other items are not obligatory unless their quantity reaches a particular threshold, which most people do not possess nowadays. One can see that the application of obligatory Zakat is much less than Khums, which is obligatory on all net income, as Allah has said  “And know that whatever thing you gain, indeed a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the Messenger and for the kinsman and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer” (8 41).The condition of the obligation of Khums, which is the existence of a net income, applies to almost everybody, however little it may be.

Not paying it is considered among the major sins for which Allah has promised hellfire. The jurists have explained the conditions and rulings about Zakat in their books. Zakat is obligatory on the following three groups of properties  (1) Gold and silver minted coins. (2) The four crops  wheat, barley, raisins and dates. (3) The four livestock  camels, cows, goats and sheep. Gold and silver coins are not used as tender nowadays, so the Zakat on this group does not apply. The Zakat on the other items are not obligatory unless their quantity reaches a particular threshold, which most people do not possess nowadays. One can see that the application of obligatory Zakat is much less than Khums, which is obligatory on all net income, as Allah has said  “And know that whatever thing you gain, indeed a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the Messenger and for the kinsman and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer” (8 41).The condition of the obligation of Khums, which is the existence of a net income, applies to almost everybody, however little it may be.

									   If one performs Umrah, does it remove his sins? If yes, does this include major sins as well? Is it true that when one leaves the sacred place in Mecca after performing Umrah it’s as if he or she was born again?
								","
									   It has been reported that Umrah is expiation from sin and this is a manifestation of God's mercy and kindness to His slaves when He legislated for them certain acts of obedience that lead to forgiveness of sins. This is a common message in the religious texts. Despite that, a devotee should be afraid of his sins so he may become closer to Allah's mercy and acceptance, and this may be an encouragement to perform more good deeds and avoid committing sins. Almighty Allah said  ""And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord; these race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race""(23 60-61).

									   I have committed a lot of sins in my life. Those sins keep coming back to haunt me and I don't know what to do. I have been praying for Allah's forgiveness day and night. For many years now I haven't found peace of mind. Specifically, please tell me how should I know that my sins have been forgiven?
								","
									   All sins can be forgiven by sincere repentance. Almighty Allah said  “Despair not of the mercy of Allah, Who forgives all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful”. Yes, it is recommended to seek forgiveness whenever the committed sins are remembered but should not turn into psychological complication.

									   My problem is I have committed a very major sin, adultery and regret it very much. I am ashamed of myself and ask Allah for forgiveness. Should I now marry the man? Will it make our sin less or will it stay the same?
								","
									   Getting married to the adulterer does not decrease the sin. What does is repentance and repeatedly seeking forgiveness. Almighty Allah said  “Say  O my slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, Who forgives all sins. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful” (39 53).
								","Hakeem"
"1395",1395,"
									   If a man does a sin and then again immediately does a good deed, will his good deed finish his sin?
								","
									   Repentance erases the sin and leads to forgiveness. It is certain that some good deeds lead to erasing the sins as Almighty Allah says  “Good deeds annul ill-deeds” 11 114. However, we cannot give a general criterion for that. For a believer, it is better to combine repentance, seeking forgiveness and performing good deeds so he may be closer to Almighty Allah’s mercy and forgiveness.
								","Hakeem"

									   According to me, a person must repent in a state of purity or in the position of prostration or standing facing Qiblah, if he has committed a lot of major sins i.e. not praying the obligatory prayers and fasts. So if a person does this, will the past major sins be forgiven?
								","
									   Repentance is regret and determination to avoid committing sins in the future. Being in the state of purity, prayers or fasting is not part of it. Yes, it is recommended to repeatedly seek forgiveness whenever sins are remembered. A devotee is expected to have high hope in Almighty Allah’s acceptance of the repentance and the forgiveness of sins. Almighty Allah said  “O my slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, Who forgives all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.” (39 53).

									   If I am not mistaken, according to a verse of the Holy Quran, Almighty Allah said that if you refrain from major sins, your minor sins will be wiped out. On the other hand, scholars say that we should refrain from minor sins too. How do we find consistency between these two points?
								","
									   The point that this verse express is that if one refrains from committing big sins, this will become a cause for the mercy of the Almighty Allah in the forgiveness of the small sins. This does not mean that one can commit small sins and disobey Almighty Allah. Furthermore, according to traditions the belittling of committing small sins or persisting in committing them is considered to be a major sin.

									   You should continue to repent to Almighty Allah from the sins you have committed, in addition to the promise that you will not commit those sins again as much as possible. If you returned to committing a sin because of the strong desire, or because of the influence of Satan, then do not despair from the mercy of Allah, and repent again, as the Almighty is Merciful to His slaves, and does not close the door of His mercy. Almighty Allah has promised His slaves with His mercy. He said  “Say  O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, Who forgives all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”(53 39).

"1532",1532,"

When I purchase any items in installments, I pay a higher amount than the normal price, and this is termed as interest. When I pay on credit, I pay later with interest. So what is the difference?
								","
									   The difference is that paying in installments is a purchase made for a specific agreed-upon price, albeit higher, over a set period; whereas buying on credit is a purchase of something for a fixed price, made through an interest-based loan, and as long as the loan is not fully repaid the interest will apply above the agreed-upon price.

									   What are the rulings regarding interest charged on loans to cushion against inflation and loss of value of currency and to cater for this inflation and loss of value?

									   Conventionally, lending is based on a specific numerical value of a currency, not the market rate of that value. For example, if $100 is borrowed, $100 is to be returned, despite any increase or decrease of the value of the dollar or any inflation. Therefore, any interest charge on a loan to cushion against inflation and loss of value is regarded as interest and the rulings pertaining to interest applies. It is not permissible to take interest from private Muslim banks. It is permissible from banks owned by the government, but one must not intend to have a contractual relationship, and when the interest money is received, one should receive it on behalf of the Marjia. It is also permissible to receive interest from non-Muslim banks.

"1539",1539,"
									   You mentioned that it is permissible to take interest from non-Muslim banks, while it is not permissible to do so with Muslim banks. On the other hand, interest is forbidden in the Quran absolutely. How can this be explained?
								","
									   Almighty Allah has made it prohibited to deal with interest in general, but the traditions of the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them all) can explain certain exemptions to this general ruling. It has been reported in these narrations that there is no prohibition in dealing with interest between a husband and his wife and between a father and his son, and it is permissible to take interest from non-Muslims. The real reason behind such rulings have not been explained in the narrations. The wisdom behind the latter exception could be that non-Muslims accept such dealings for themselves, as they give and take interest in their dealings without hesitation or seeing anything wrong with it.

								","

When I purchase any items in installments, I pay a higher amount than the normal price, and this is termed as interest. When I pay on credit, I pay later with interest. So what is the difference?
								","
									   The difference is that paying in installments is a purchase made for a specific agreed-upon price, albeit higher, over a set period; whereas buying on credit is a purchase of something for a fixed price, made through an interest-based loan, and as long as the loan is not fully repaid the interest will apply above the agreed-upon price.

For example, if $100 is borrowed, $100 is to be returned, despite any increase or decrease of the value of the dollar or any inflation. Therefore, any interest charge on a loan to cushion against inflation and loss of value is regarded as interest and the rulings pertaining to interest applies. It is not permissible to take interest from private Muslim banks.

The real reason behind such rulings have not been explained in the narrations. The wisdom behind the latter exception could be that non-Muslims accept such dealings for themselves, as they give and take interest in their dealings without hesitation or seeing anything wrong with it.

"1775",1775,"
									   I want to know why temporary marriage is permissible.
								","
									   Muslims have unanimously agreed that temporary marriage was legislated by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). The second caliph stopped people from doing it during his rule at a famous incident. Since it was legislated by the Prophet, it remains lawful and valid. And this is what the followers of the Ahlul-bait (peace be upon him) and a group of the companions of the prophets (peace be upon him) believe.
								","Hakeem"
"1776",1776,"
									   Some Muslims object to the permissibility of temporary marriage. Can you please provide me with evidence to support its legality?
								","
									   There is no doubt that the temporary marriage is legislated. Proof is present in the Holy Book and the noble traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) which are authenticated in the Sunni and Shia books. What happened after that is that the second Caliph prevented it and its prohibition then became widely accepted amongst the Sunni scholars. What indicates its legislation from the Holy Book is the following verse  â€œIt is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom you seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty."" (24 4) In the book of Nail Al-Awtar, Vol.6, Pg.270, it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas used to recite this verse and he used to add ""by a set time"" after ""And those of whom you seek content"" and this clearly explains the legislation of the temporary marriage. In this same book it is mentioned that Ibn Abbas stated that temporary marriage was a mercy that Almighty Allah has given to his slaves and if it was not the forbidding of Umar, no one would ever need to commit adultery.  In the book of Al-Muhalla, vol. 9, pg. 520, the author, Ibn Hazm, stated  ""The permissibility of temporary marriage after the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) was affirmed by a group of his companions like Asma, the daughter of Abu Bakr, Jabir bin Abdillah, Ibn Masoud, Ibn Abbas, Moawiyah bin Abi Sufyan ""The list continues on until he said  ""and most jurists of the holy city of Mecca"". From this, one can conclude that the disagreement started after the prohibition of Umar and not in its legislation itself.
								","Hakeem"
"1777",1777,"
									   I understand that temporary marriage is for pleasure. Does that mean that physical attraction and lust are permissible reasons to enter into such a contract, or are there other prerequisite motivations that one must have before two people can enter into this arrangement?
								","
									   It is permissible to enter into temporary marriage for the sake of pleasure and lust via legislated means and within religious guidelines. Among the benefits of temporary marriage is that it controls sexual relation between the two sexes within specific rules and guidelines; like specifying the duration of the marriage and the dower, serving the waiting period between one marriage and another, and the child born from such a matrimony being legitimate for the couple. There is no doubt that if such marriage was common in the society, committing adultery would be minimal.
								","Hakeem"
"1778",1778,"
									   Does a temporary marriage contract only become valid when the woman realizes that it is a marriage with religious commitments? Or is it not obligatory for the woman to realize this? As mentioning this may strongly cause some women to not wish to go forth with it anymore due to how serious it sounds. If the answer is yes, then can it be said in other words?
								","
									   If the two parties agreed on forming a marriage contract between them in such a way that the paid money is considered as dower like the permanent marriage, then the marriage is valid. If she understands that the relationship allows her to have sexual acts in return for a fee, then it is adultery. The same can be said if she understands the relationship as a form of friendship.

One who does not have the means to achieve it by a legitimate way, should have patience and dependence on Almighty Allah, as He said  â€œAnd whosoever puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice himâ€<U+009D> (65 3).

However, if the man was ill – and clearly appeared to be so – when the marriage contract took place, she will inherit from him only if they consummated the marriage. If the marriage was not consummated in this case, she does not inherit from him after his death, and there is no dower, and there is no need for her to observe the waiting period (Iddah).

									   Are the wives of the Prophet included in Ahlulbayt (peace be upon them) according to the 33rd verse of Surah al-Ahzab?
								","
									   The verse does not include the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) since the wife – based on Arabic custom – is not included in the term “household” usually. This term refers to the genealogy of the man and his relatives by blood. It was narrated in the book “Lisan ul-Arab” that Ibn Sayyidah – an expert in Arabic linguistics – stated that the term “ahl” refers to the tribe of the man and his blood relatives. Apparently, this meaning was clear during the first era of Islam, since history did not mention that the aforementioned term is given to the wives by the companions of the Prophet. It was not used by the wives of the Prophet themselves. Aisha – for example – led an army to fight Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and her supporters were trying to gain the support of Muslims by any possible mean. Yet they did not mention that she is a member of the Ahlulbait. It appears from numerous traditions narrated by Muslims in general that the Messenger of Allah used this phrase to refer to Ali, Hasan, Husain and Fatima (peace be upon them). Ahmed bin Hanbal narrated in his book (Al-Musnad) from Umm Salama that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) told Fatima (peace be upon her), “Call for me your husband and your two sons”. She did so, and he then placed a blanket over them and then he placed his hand over them and said  ”O Lord, these are the Aal of Mohammad, so place your blessings on Mohammad and the Aal of Mohammad. All praise and glory belong to you.” Umm Salama raised the blanket to join with them. The Messenger of Allah prevented her and said  “Your future is good”. Many other traditions narrated by Sunni scholars mentioned clearly that the noble verse (33 33) was revealed while they were under the blanket. In addition to that, what some of the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) did clearly indicates that they were not purified from committing sins; some verses of chapter 66 (al-Tahreem) were revealed condemning Aisha and Hafsa since they aided one another against the Messenger of Allah. It was also narrated that one of the Prophet’s wife, Qutaila bint Qais left the religion of Islam after the death of the Prophet and got married to Ikrama bin Abi Jahl.

								","
									   The verses and the narrations that are reported in the superiority of the Ahlulbait are specific to the five infallibles  The Prophet, Imam Ali, Fatima Al-Zahra, Imam Hasan and Imam Husain (peace be upon them all).

								","
									   Our connection to the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is not emotional; rather, it is religious and based on their infallibility. Almighty Allah has ordered us to follow them. He said  ""Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Ahlulbait, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing""(33 33). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered us to follow them. He said  ""I am leaving amongst you the two weighty things, the book of Allah, and my progeny"". In addition to that, there are narrations about each and every one of the Imams of the Ahlulbait specifically. As an example, the Messenger of Allah said  “Ali is your Wali (i.e. guardian) after me” and he said  “Whoever’s master I am, Ali is his master”. These and other religious texts show that these people have special characteristics that enable them to take their position of imamate and leadership. So the issue is not emotional, nor is it based on a tribe or a family. On the other hand, most believers in the Sunni sect accepted the legitimacy of the caliphate of the Umayyads and Abbasids, although both of these states were established and continued on the basis of inheritance and without any entitlement at all.

									   The Dua (supplication) is a “request”, and since Almighty Allah is in charge of the universe and manages all creations, asking Him is direct. Requesting from others, like the Prophets or the Imams, is not permissible if the seeker considers them as being independent in dealing with his request, aside from Almighty Allah. This is like considering a partner with Almighty Allah. If the believer seeks the intercession of the Prophets and the Imams (peace be upon them) as they can then ask Almighty Allah to fulfill the seeker’s supplication, or he requests from Almighty Allah to fulfill his supplication by referring to the high rank of the noble personalities of the Prophets and the Imams (peace be upon them), then these two kinds of supplications are considered as permissible acts of worship.

									   It was reported in some authentic narrations of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) the emphasis on crying, showing sadness and grief for Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) and establishing the mourning ceremonies for his tragedy and refraining from eating or drinking on the day of Ashura - without the intention of fasting - and breaking it with little water and food after noon. It was reported also to refrain from going out for regular needs on such occasions. It was also reported that whoever goes out to fulfill one of his needs that day, Almighty Allah will not bless it if it was fulfilled. It was also reported the emphasis on presenting grief and sadness for the tragedies of the Ahlulbait in general and there is no doubt that the days of their martyrdoms are the best to do so.

								","
									   The meaning of the verse is that a human being by his nature does not know the time of his death. This does not mean that all people are like that.

It was reported in an authentic narration that one of the companions asked Imam Al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), “How should we fare with each other, with our own people and with people who do not espouse our beliefs?” The Imam (peace be upon him) said, ""You should look up to your Imams whom you follow and do as they do. By Allah, they visit their sick, attend their funerals, testify for or against them and return the trust to them."" The enemies of the Ahlulbait are those who hate them and bear animosity with them.

Having said that, this innate belief strengthens inside many people who live in an atheistic material environment when they face crises, as they are compelled to believe in Allah and seek refuge and help from Him. The Holy Quran confirmed this truth in many verses.

Amongst them  - ""Your guardian can be only Allah, and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the poor due while bowing down (in prayer)."" (Quran 5 55) This verse was revealed at the incident where Imam Ali (peace be upon him) gave his ring as charity while he was bowing in prayer. The verse joined his guardianship to the guardianship of the messenger of Allah, which is the leadership of the Muslim nation, i.e. the Imamate. - ""Nor does he speak of (his own) desire"" (Quran 53 3). The verse indicates that what the Prophet says is from Almighty Allah. The orders of the Prophet were to follow his household when he said in this commonly known narration  “I leave among you the two weighty things  the book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you are attached to them both, you will never be misguided."" The Prophet also ordered us to follow Imam Ali in the famous narration of Ghadeer  ""Whosoever’s master I am, Ali is his master.""

The said tradition is widely recognized in the Shia and Sunnis books of traditions. Similar to this is the tradition of Al-Ghadeer and other narrations as well.

									   This topic entails a detailed discussion, but in summary Allah said  “And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful” (4 64). It is clear that the intercession of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) is one of the causes of divine mercy and forgiveness, and there is no evidence that this is limited to his life, especially with the traditions narrated from him that indicate that he replies to our salutations and greetings to him after his death; so just as salutations reach him after his death, so do our requests for his intercession.

									   The Holy Prophet said that his intercession is for those who committed major sins. He also said that whoever does not believe in his intercession does not deserve it. But according to me, I do not want to expect intercession from anyone in this world, and that is an advantage, because if you do then you will commit sins and you might not repent for that because you think that Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) will intercede for me on the Day of Reckoning. So is it an obligation to believe and expect intercession from the holy Prophet and holy Imams and Fatima Al Zahra (peace be on them) on Day of Judgment?
								","
									   Intercession means to seek from the prophets and divinely appointed holy leaders the mercy of Allah and His forgiveness. It is a Quranic concept confirmed by the teachings of the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them all). However, a righteous devotee is encouraged to avoid sins, and if they occur, to repent to Almighty Allah and return to Him asking forgiveness and mercy. At the same time, he should ask the Prophet and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) to intercede and ask the Almighty Allah to grant him His mercy and acceptance. There is no doubt that joining between repentance and the intercession is more secure to obtain salvation rather than relying on repentance alone.Having said that, this does not mean that one should rely on intercession and commit sins as this leads to disregarding sins, which is one of the greatest sins that may disqualify the person from deserving intercession. Committing sins while belittling them leads to disregarding Allah's punishment and it is amongst the greatest sins. This might lead to losing the good end of this life and not dying as a believer, which is - no doubt - one of the conditions of deserving intercession. There is a difference between the desire of getting the intercession and the hope that one gets it, on one hand, and depending on intercession and committing sins because of this dependence on the other hand. The former places the person far from committing sins, whereas the latter encourages the person to commit sins and may lose, at the end, the chance to get the intercession.

									   How can we prove the imamate of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) from the Holy Quran?
								","
									   The imamate of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) can be proven from the holy Quran by a number of ways. Amongst them  - ""Your guardian can be only Allah, and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the poor due while bowing down (in prayer)."" (Quran 5 55) This verse was revealed at the incident where Imam Ali (peace be upon him) gave his ring as charity while he was bowing in prayer. The verse joined his guardianship to the guardianship of the messenger of Allah, which is the leadership of the Muslim nation, i.e. the Imamate. - ""Nor does he speak of (his own) desire"" (Quran 53 3). The verse indicates that what the Prophet says is from Almighty Allah. The orders of the Prophet were to follow his household when he said in this commonly known narration  “I leave among you the two weighty things  the book of Allah and my progeny; as long as you are attached to them both, you will never be misguided."" The Prophet also ordered us to follow Imam Ali in the famous narration of Ghadeer  ""Whosoever’s master I am, Ali is his master."" In another narration, the Prophet said  ""Ali is your master after my demise,"" and many more narrations.

									   How can we prove Imamate from the Quran? If Imamate is such a backbone for Shia Islam and we believe that if one does not accept the Wilayah of Imam Ali (peace be upon him), he is at loss, then why did not Allah mention this directly in the Holy Quran, thus avoiding major disputes? How do we answer the objection that there is no proof about the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) being essential?
								","
									   This question presents important issues that require an explanation, since this is one of the most important fallacies that the enemies of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) present. We would like to draw your attention to a few important issues in order to clarify the truth Firstly  Doubting the Imamate of the Ahlulbait just because it is not mentioned in the Holy Book is in reality doubting the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) and belittling his position in being an essential source of religious laws and a speaker of the truth, which in turn raises a big question on the credibility of Islam as a religion and the Holy book as a divine text that “falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it,” as the Quran states clearly. But rather, the Quran itself presents the Messenger of Allah and his conduct as the truth that is not associated with any falsehood, misguidance and forgetfulness. This is explicitly mentioned in the Holy Quran, when the Almighty stated, “Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired,” (Quran 53 3-4) and “whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids, abstain (from it),” (Quran 7 59) and also, “But nay, by thy Lord, they will not have (true) faith until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decides, and submit with full submission.”(Quran 65 4) Based on this, a Muslim should research about Imamate as well as the position of the Sunnah in its regards, just as he looks for the position of the Sunnah with respect to the religious obligations like the prayers, the fast, pilgrimage and the like, as these essential obligations are not mentioned in the Holy Book with detail, but the Sunnah explained the ways to perform them. It is sufficient to prove the Imamate by referring to the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis, like the book of al-Bukhari and the book of Muslim and all the authenticated books in which they included narrations of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) that refer in a clear way to the leadership of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) after the Prophet, like when he said  “Whosoever’s master I am, Ali is his master.” Also  “Ali is your wali (leader) after me.” And also, when he said to Ali (peace be upon him)  “You are to me like Aaron was to Moses, but there is no prophet after me,” and the like in innumerable narrations. There are other narrations that relate to the religious authority of the Ahlubait (peace be upon them) in general, like  “I am leaving among you two weighty things  the Book of Allah and my household; as long as you are attached to them both, you shall never be misguided.”Secondly  there are verses of the Holy Quran which, as the narrations indicate, were revealed in respect of Imam Ali (peace be upon him). They are narrated by Sunni Muslims. They also indicate in a clear way the Imamate of Imam Ali (peace be upon them) like when Almighty Allah said, “Your guardian can be only Allah, and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the alms, while they bow down (in prayer).” (Quran 55 5) And even the verse, “Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you with authority.” (Quran 59 4) They indicate in a clear way that those in authority whose obedience is necessary are infallible since – based on the verse – one should obey them as one obeys Almighty Allah and likewise the Messenger of Allah, and nobody fulfills this condition except the Imams of the Ahlulbait, whom Almighty Allah purified with a thorough purification as per the verse 33 33. Furthermore, Muslims have unanimously agreed on the righteousness of the Imams of the Ahlulbait, their highness, the strength in their faith, their knowledge in the affairs of religion, as this clearly appears to the individual who looks at their history and biography. Could any Muslim accept that Almighty Allah would order Muslims to obey those in authority by applying this title on anyone that assumes power, whether he does this by force or through inheritance, even if he committed the most heinous of crimes like Yazid bin Mu’awiyah and similar despots? Are the aforementioned verses not sufficient in proving the Imamate of the Ahlulbait from the Quran for the fair-minded searcher for the truth?Thirdly  What you have mentioned – that if the Holy Quran had named Imam Ali (peace be upon him) clearly as the successor to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) there would be no conflict between Muslims – is not correct. There are a number of verses that clearly describe certain rulings, and, despite that, Muslims did not agree on them; an example of such a case is the verse of ablution in which the way of performing ablution has been clearly explained, and there is no doubt that the verse is clear in its meaning when it was revealed, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) used to perform wudhu repeatedly in the presence of Muslims. Despite all this, there was a difference in opinion in understanding it. Another example is the verses of divorce which indicate that the three consecutive divorces pronounced in one place and time is not considered as three divorces – by which a man cannot return to the wife – but some Muslim jurists regard this type of divorce as valid and a man cannot return to his wife thereafter. There are many other such examples in jurisprudential issues, although all Muslims base their conclusions on the Holy Book. Furthermore, if one looks in the biography of the Prophet, he could clearly conclude that some of his companions were not obeying him or even respecting him properly. They used to dare to disobey him and not care about his orders; it is sufficient to mention some incidents from the trusted books of narrations of the Sunnis  (1) Most of the Muslims fled from a number of battles that were led by the Messenger of Allah, like Uhud, Hunayn and Khaybar, whereas the Holy Book states clearly the prohibition to do so and that whoever does so will be punished in Hell for eternity. Almighty Allah said  “Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.”(Quran 16 8) (2) What took place during the “tragedy of Thursday”  Abdullah bin Abbas – as it is narrated in the Sunni books of narrations like the Musnad of Ahmad – said, weeping, “The day of Thursday! And what day was Thursday!! The Messenger of Allah said to us  “Bring to me a broad bone [to be used to write on] and ink, so I may write for you something that you shall not be misguided after it is written.” Umar said  “The Messenger of Allah is incoherent.” In some of the narrations, they were arguing; some of them were in favor of Umar and some others were saying, “Bring for the Messenger of Allah what he asked for.” The Messenger of Allah said then  “Leave me!! There should not be a fight in my presence.” From the said incident one can conclude that the refusal of the Prophet to write what he wanted to write was to preserve the dignity of Prophethood, since it is not appropriate for the Prophet to order for something in a clear and direct way and Muslim differ in their opinions whether to obey him or not, since there should be no dispute after the order has been issued. From this, one can conclude the reason why the name of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was not mentioned in the Holy Book; Almighty Allah knew that there were some people who wanted to rule and were ready to disobey Allah and His Messenger in an open way, and they had their supporters who were willing to help and encourage them. If the Holy Quran was to mention Imam Ali’s name, then they would doubt the Holy Book in the same way as they have doubted the Messenger of Allah. This would result in the rejection or alteration of the Holy Book.

									   Why did Almighty Allah appoint Imams?
								","
									   Almighty Allah appointed the Imams to guard the religion and protect it from misguidance and to continue the message of Islam that started with the prophethood of Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him and his household) for mankind. People did not obey Allah’s orders in this matter due to their desire to possess authority and to be in control. This led to tragedies amongst Muslims for centuries until they separated into different sects and were controlled by the infidels. Almighty Allah said  “And if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil, surely we should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth. But (unto every messenger) they gave the lie, and so we seized them on account of what they used to earn.” (7 96)

									   What is the relevance of the concept of Wilayat (authority) of the Imams in our lives today?
								","
									   We can comment on your question by stating the following  1. The Imamate of the Imams (peace be upon them) has been legislated by Almighty Allah for people to observe. Every Muslim must obey all that has been proven to be divinely legislated obligations without considering the immediate benefit of the law on his everyday life since believing in a religion is believing in all what is proven to be part of it. 2. Believing in the Wilayat of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) is following them and observing their teachings. This has a great effect on the way a believer deals with day-to-day matters based on the teachings and the guidelines that originate from them. We can see that amongst the characteristics of the followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) by which they are known today is their condemnation of terrorism and tyranny against innocents, especially children, women and old people, and this is not but a reflection of their attachment with the humane teachings of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them).

									   As we know, Imamate is a divine position that cannot be taken away by anybody.

What exactly was taken away from him, because the true believers were still following him?
								","
									   What you said is true. Imamate is a divine position that cannot be taken by anyone. The application of this right is represented by the management of the affairs of people with justice according to the divine rules of Almighty Allah, and since Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was not able to exercise this right of authority for some time, we can say that the ruling and management of the affairs of people based on correct religious standards was taken from him.

It is enough to refer to this narration that Al-Kulayni reported to clear this fallacy  “A man asked Imam Ali (peace be upon him)  Since when has your Lord existed? Imam replied  ""When was He ever absent so one could ask  since when did He exist?"".

He has ordered people to follow them. So, if it is possible for them to commit sins, they might order people to do so as well and people have to follow them. So their orders would not be trusted to be from Almighty Allah, and He will not order us to follow somebody who can misguide us. Similarly, they are to be taken by their followers as role models.

									   The said letter is not different from the rest of the letters found in Nahjul Balagha. The doubt about the authenticity of the letter may come from the fact that this letter includes advises directed to Imam Hassan (peace be upon him) which raises the question about the need of the young Imam to such directions although he is infallible. Apparently, the said doubt is not valid since this way of presenting advice could be for the sake of reminding the person and repeatedly giving him the advice. The Quran used this way when Almighty Allah said  “And warn, for warning profits believers.” (51 55) Also, it could be indirect guidance to all Muslims by directing the advice to Imam Hassan (peace be upon him). This way is also mentioned in the Holy book as well. Almighty Allah said  “And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no Allah save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back.” (28 88) In this verse God is addressing the Prophet with guidance, while it is abundantly clear that the Prophet would not worship anyone but Almighty Allah.

									   Did the Prophet and the Imams (peace be upon them) do Taqiyya?
								","
									   Taqiyya is position that one takes to express an idea he does not believe in or waive his right on a matter, in order to protect himself from being harmed. Taqiyya was established in the Holy Book when Almighty Allah said  “Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless (it be) that ye but guard yourselves against them, taking (as it were) security. Allah biddeth you beware (only) of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying” (3-21).He also said  “Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief – save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief  On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom” (16-6). This last verse was revealed when Ammar bin Yasir was coerced to let the idolaters hear what they wanted to hear, words of disbelief, in order to avoid being tortured further. When he stated this to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), he approved what Ammar did. The Prophet even told Ammar that if the idolaters return to you, let them hear again what you told them. This incident is mentioned in various books of history and Quranic commentaries. The Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) were subject to difficult situations, and they were forced to apparently recognize the rulers of their times, even though the Imams knew of the oppression and tyranny of such rulers.

									   I have heard from Ahl Al-Sunnah that a Shia Marja stated the following  ""Reconciliatory Taqiyyah. This type of Taqiyyah is done when a person intends to reconcile with the other side or when he intends to soften their hearts. This kind of Taqiyyah is permissible but not obligatory."" They have related this belief to the verse  “When they [hypocrites] meet those who believe, they say  ‘We believe.’ But when they are alone with their evil ones, they say  ‘We are really with you, we (were) only jesting.’” (Quran, 2 14) I am having a hard time replying to this.
								","
									   The connection made between reconciliatory Taqiyya – which is based on softening the hearts – and the mentioned verse is originated from intolerance against the Shias and ignorance of the reasons and justifications behind Taqiyyah. All Muslims are under the flag of Islam and softening their heart by the decrease of their differences is amongst the interests that has concerned the Shias and their Imams throughout history. The mentioned verse speaks of the hypocrites who do not believe in the Hereafter or in the foundations of the religion, and they claim to be Muslims in front of other Muslims. So how are those people considered to be attempting to unite the Muslims and decrease the level of differences between them? Those fanatics do not understand anything but intolerance and rejection of other sects and disregarding them, and do not care about the image of Islam or its high concerns. Today they are more harmful than the direct enemies of Islam as a result of their behaviors that originated from narrow-minded thinking and blind prejudice.

Since Islam is the seal of religions, these laws are for until the end of this world. Because of corruption, badness and evilness in certain things or acts, He commanded us to refrain from them and made them prohibited. Similarly, because of benefits and goodness in certain other things, He ordered us to perform them and made them obligatory on us. Some of these laws are general and apply to all people, all the time, and anywhere.The ability of the human being is limited, so is unable to find out and understand the reasons behind the Sharia of Almighty Allah. Sometimes Allah Almighty has taught us through the Holy Prophet and the Imams (peace be upon them), the wisdom behind certain few rulings. We must obey His laws by refraining from the prohibited acts and undertaking the obligatory acts, even if we do not know the reason behind each and every one of them.The najasah of the dog is one of the rulings about which we do not know the wisdom behind.

Verses from the Holy Book prove it, such as  “Allah effaces what He wills, and establishes (what He wills), and with Him is the source of ordinance.” (39 13) Aside from this, there are numerous narrations, which explain that Almighty Allah’s knowledge does not change by the sequence of events. Some incidents might lead, as they happen based on their natural sequence, to a different result and its real destiny that Almighty Allah knows may not correspond to what one might imagine from preceding incidents. Bada' can take place for any incident, including the issue of the passing of Imamate. Almighty Allah limited this position to certain personalities. However, people could conclude from certain circumstances that a different person will fill this position. Because of his piety, Isma'il, the oldest son of Imam Jafar Al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), was seen by Shias to be the next Imam after his father’s death, and for some of them it may have been something very obvious. But Almighty Allah knew that this will not happen, and thus Isma'il died during his father’s lifetime, and the next Imam was Isma'il's brother, Musa al-Kadhim (peace be upon him).

									   1.	Thank you for contacting us and we emphasize on our interest in submitting what can be to serve the truth and reality. We want to draw your attention to an important issue in your journey to seek the truth and pick the right path which is that you should search for the evidences that each side claim to prove the correctness of its view. So you should search for what the shia give as a proof to the obligation to follow the Ahlulbyte after the death of the prophet and do not look for the details at the present stage. If their argument were proven to you then you can look for explanations to their practices if you were convinced with them, you can practice them as well otherwise you can refuse to practice them. If you were to start searching for the explanations to the details of the practices then this might confuse you more.
2.	The thing that the imams of the Ahlulbyte emphasized on is the mourning and expressing pain and passion because of the oppression that the Ahlulbyte undertook, the disasters and the pains that they faced. The course of practice that devotee chose to express the mentioned obligation is entirely personal. Some express their feelings towards Imam Hussein (Peace be upon him) and his companions and his household by crying, expressing their sadness and wearing black clothes. Others do so by slapping their chests. Some others use bleeding as a way to express they sympathy with the imam and his household and companions as they were killed and stabbed with spears, swards and arrows.","Hakeem"

									   The mentioned narrations are rejected by Shias and Sunnis, which suggests the lack of credibility in these traditions.

Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (peace be upon him) recited the Holy Book ten times during the holy month. It was also narrated that Imam Ali Al-Ridha (peace be upon him) did the same. Since the earliest days of Islam, there were certain reciters who specialized in the recitation of the Quran and they taught it to others. As such, the Book was widespread amongst the Muslims in general, not to any special class in the Muslim society, and they went to great lengths to preserve the words of the Quran without any changes and alterations. All of this indicates that the Holy Quran which we currently have, reached us from generation after generation. Therefore, the claim that you refer to in your question is meaningless and rejected.

Is there any truth to this?
								","
									   The mentioned narrations are rejected by Shias and Sunnis, which suggests the lack of credibility in these traditions. Muslims were paying attention since the very early days of Islam in memorizing the Holy Book, reciting it, teaching it and spreading it. It was reported that the month of Ramadan is the spring season of the Holy Book, referring to the best time of the year. It was a common practice to recite the entire Quran during this month. Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir (peace be upon him) recited the Holy Book ten times during the holy month. It was also narrated that Imam Ali Al-Ridha (peace be upon him) did the same. Since the earliest days of Islam, there were certain reciters who specialized in the recitation of the Quran and they taught it to others. As such, the Book was widespread amongst the Muslims in general, not to any special class in the Muslim society, and they went to great lengths to preserve the words of the Quran without any changes and alterations. All of this indicates that the Holy Quran which we currently have, reached us from generation after generation. Therefore, the claim that you refer to in your question is meaningless and rejected.

Therefore, I would like to know what is your opinion concerning the current order of the verses in the Quran and was it set by the Prophet(s) and compiled in his lifetime?
								","
									   There is no doubt that Almighty Allah protected the Holy Quran from any changes or alterations and such protection played an important role in guarding the religion and protecting it from alterations and changes. The reason for that might be the fact that the verses of the Holy Quran were collected in one book and guarded during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and continued to be like that generation after generation until today.

The current books of Quran that are spread in all Muslim countries serve as evidence to this truth. Muslims consider reciting the entirety of the current copies of the Quran to be the complete reciting of the Book of Allah. Similarly, a recitation of a Surah in the current Quran is considered to be the recitation of the complete Surah. They do not add a word or remove another. The said is clear in their understanding, conduct and in the verdicts of their religious scholars. This practical consensus is one of the strongest proofs of the Muslims’ position in general – whether they are Shia or Sunni – on the Holy Quran. Nothing can stand against such evidence as it expresses the fact that the noble Quran is entirely extant in the current book as an existing and self-evident truth. Muslims have acknowledged it and implemented it, while all fallacies seeking to cause doubt in it have failed.”

This is one of the evidences that the Quran is from Almighty Allah and not from the Prophet, since he did not exhibit any writing in his life. Despite that, he brought this great book that contains very high concepts in many aspects of intellect and in life.

It is clear that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) is perfect and infallible. In addition to that, Allah explicitly declared that he “he does not speak of (his own) desire” (53 3). Because of this the Muslims believe in all that is established to be the Prophet’s words.

									   I am interested to know what the Muslim faith thinks of the Catholic faith in particular Jesus, Mary, the mother of god and the holy bible. As your faith is widely misconceived
								","
									   Thank you for your communication with us about important and sensitive subjects that relates to the main catholic beliefs. We admire your way in approaching us to learn about the truth from a reliable Islamic source. We advise you to recite the Quran, and refer to it to learn about Muslim beliefs as it is their holy book and they believe in it with total conviction.
Muslimsâ€™ belief in the divine existence of God is based on proofs and evidences mentioned in a clear way in the Holy Book. They believe that God is one, and He is all surrounding things. He holds all the attributes of goodness. The last two verses from the 59th chapter refer to this when Almighty Allah said  â€œHe is Allah, other than Whom there is no other Allah, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. () He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wiseâ€<U+009D>.
When man explores the greatness of this universe â€“ by learning and searching using the modern means, in such a way that is very amazing way, it becomes very clear that Almighty Allahâ€™s greatness, capability and encompassing are in an absolute measure and beyond imagination when He created this huge universe with this perfection from nothingness. This, by itself, is sufficient to prove the greatness of the Lord and His absolute capability and wisdom.
Jesus is mentioned in the holy Quran numerous times with respect and appreciation, as he is one of the righteous slaves of God whom He sent unto mankind to guide them to believe in monotheism and to obey His orders and to propagate them. Verses 45-51 from the 3rd chapter refers to this truth when Almighty God said  â€<U+009D>(And remember) when the angels said  O Mary! Lo! Allah gives thee glad tidings of a Word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (unto Allah).() He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of the righteous. () She said  My Lord! How can I have a child when no man hath touched me? He said  So (it will be). Allah creates what He wills. If He decrees a thing, He saith unto it only  Be! and it is.() And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel, () And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying)  Lo! I come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers. ()And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. () Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.â€<U+009D>
Mary was a righteous woman; Almighty Allah took special care of her when He made one of His great prophets, Zachariah, as her guardian. She was mentioned in the holy Quran numerously like when Almighty Allah said in verses 35-37 from the 3rd chapter   â€<U+009D>(Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said  My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my womb as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! () And when she was delivered she said  My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast. () And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said  O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)? She answered  It is from Allah. Allah gives without measure to whom He will.â€<U+009D>
The Holy Quran mentioned the birth of Jesus, the son of Mary, and how it was by Godâ€™s order and not in a usual way of creating the human being, as Mary gave birth to Jesus without marriage as a virgin. She was facing the accusations of the society and mischief makers of committing the sin; but the Almighty Lord proved her innocence when her noble son Jesus spoke in his first hours. This was one of Godâ€™s miracles and implementation of Godâ€™s will in a direct way by giving birth to this blessed child. Verses 16-35 from chapter 19, Chapter of Mary, explain this incident when Almighty Allah said â€<U+009D> And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, () And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man () She said  Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing. () He said  I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son () She said  How can I have a son when no man hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? () He said  So (it will be). Thy Lord saith  It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. () And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. () And the pains of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said  Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! () Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying  Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, () And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee () So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say  Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and I will not speak this day to any man. () Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said  O Mary! Thou hast come with a string thing. () O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. () Then she pointed to him. They said  How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? () He spake  Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, () And hath made me blessed whosesoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, () And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. () Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! () Such was Jesus, son of Mary  (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. () It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only  Be! and it is. ()â€<U+009D>
The Bible is amongst the godly revealed books which are mentioned in the holy Quran in many verses. Its aim was to clarify the religious truths and the divine religion of Allah which Jesus brought from Almighty Allah. Verse 46 from chapter 5 refers to this in a clear way when Almighty Lord said  â€œAnd We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).â€<U+009D>

He directed his nation to the right direction after his death when he ordered them to guard the teachings of the Quran and the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them). He guaranteed that if both were adhered to, they will never be misguided. Part of the nation of Islam abandoned the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) and the differences between the nation of Islam became a reality. We, as followers of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) should act upon their teachings and uphold their directions to the right path, while dealing with the rest of the Muslims with good manners and etiquettes, and not raise the differences or cause hatred against them, since we all believe in Almighty Allah and His Messenger and the common religious obligations, like prayers, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, etc., in order to preserve the general entity of Islam.

									   ‘Irfan’ is a word derived from ‘Ma’rifah’, which is the personal cognizance and understanding that affects the self. It has become a term for certain ideas related to the universe and existence in general, and to God, His attributes and His names. On the other hand, ‘irfan’ has the objective of the purification of one's self, and may entail claims of discoveries and observations beyond the usual capabilities and perceptions of humans. Some might consider this knowledge to be similar to divine revelation, so it may cause one to fall into dangers, as one may then not be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Indeed, because of this, many have fallen into clear violations of the Sharia. This has been one of the reasons of misguidance, until it reached the level that religious obligations were dropped and the mention of God in the heart was considered to be sufficient without the need to perform the religious obligations. Hence, it is necessary for the believers to beware of getting into this field without discernment. Instead, they should adhere to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah, which emphasize acting upon the Sharia duties which are related to the relationship with God, like prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, zakat, etc., as well as those obligations related to social duties, such as being dutiful to parents, having good relationships with relatives, having good communication and empathy with other believers, giving sufficient attention to family members, with due regard to their rights and raising them in a proper way, and other obligations that are explained in books of religious jurisprudence. The Islamic sources have emphasized the performance of religious acts in a particular prescribed way, so the believer can fulfil his religious responsibilities. They also recommend various voluntary acts of worship to allow us to get closer to God and to lead to our good deeds gaining divine acceptance. The Islamic sources have also emphasized non-reliance on this world and to not be overly concerned about it, and they have explained that the world is a temporary abode and we are on a short journey through it. They say that one should equip himself in this finite world with good deeds and high morals, and only this can be an asset to take to the next world and ensure one’s eternal happiness, amongst the righteous followers and the Prophets and Imams (peace be upon them). The Islamic sources have also given emphasis on the importance of exhortation and remembrance of the Hereafter, and reflection on the demise of the world and its manifestations. One should not become negligent or forgetful of this. Thus, the values and ideals are enriched in himself and his soul will no longer pay attention to the world and its delusions that lead to sins and wrongdoings. Believers are advised to give due attention to the recitation of the Quran and the supplications narrated from the Prophet and his household (peace be upon them all), as well as their advice and teachings. All of these have a great impact in raising the soul and purifying it from vices; and before all of this, believers are urged to rely on Almighty Allah and seek His mercy and grace, which will lead to their guidance and protection from sins and evil.

Non-Muslims will be punished because of their refusal to believe in Almighty Allah and His Messenger (Peace be upon him.

In addition to that, the ziyarats consist of refreshing the loyalty and the love of the imams plus the encouragement to follow the imam that is being visited by the ziyarat as the ziyarat usually contains praising the prophet and the imams by being righteous slaves of the lord, devoted to Him and doers of religious obligations.","Hakeem"

									   Imam Hasan Askari said that a devotee has 5 identities. Ziyarat e arbayeen is one of them. Should this read only 20 safer or daily to a believer?
								","
									   What the narration means is that it is recommended to recite the ziyara on the 20th of Safer. Yes, it is permissible to do that anytime with the hope that the believer is rewarded for such an action.

									   Ziarat-e-Ashura is recommended to be recited for 40 days continuously. My question is Can a woman recite the ziarat during her menstrual cycle? At the end of the ziarat, there is one sajdah. If a woman does choose to recite the ziarat during her menstrual cycle, what does she have to do when she has to prostrate?
								","
									   The mentioned ziyara is recommended every day and not only on a continuous 40 days. Yes, it is known to believers that reciting it continually is amongst the reasons to answer the requests in the supplications. The woman in her period can recite the ziyara without praying the two rakat prayers; she can do the rest including the prostration.

									   What is the most effective supplication/ziyarat?
								","
									   There are many ziyarats taught by the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) like al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah, Ziyarat Warith and Ziyarat Ashura. There are also many supplications, like Du’a Kumayl and the supplications of al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyah.

									   I want to go to Karbala for Ziyarah, for which I saved up for, but there is an amount of Khums that I am due to pay. If I pay that, I do not have enough to go for Ziyarah. Can I still go for Ziyarah without paying the Khums?
								","
									   You should pay the khums first, as paying the khums is obligatory and going for ziyarah is recommended. You can recite the ziyarah from where you are and you shall be rewarded for it a great reward. Bear in mind that paying the khums is one of the causes of blessing in one’s income.

									   If a person lives very distant from the shrines of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) and cannot reach there, is the recitation of Ziyara and salutation from afar equally virtuous and acceptable?
								","
									   There are no narrated texts from the Imams of the Ahlulbait (peace be upon them) that explain such an issue and clarify it. However, there is nothing wrong with reciting the Ziyara from far away with the hope that it is rewarded.
